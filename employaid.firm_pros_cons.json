Our health insurance options are still decent but have gotten much more expensive, with higher deductibles and lesser coverage every single year.  This is particularly true for family coverage.  Many of us use our spouse's insurance if they work elsewhere.  Our 401k matching used to be great.  They have cut the matching in half and now only match at the end of the year. This means if they lay you off on Dec 30, you get nothing. (Yes, they did lay people off in December).  Quite a few people who are doing \"good\" but not stellar work have not seen a raise in 5+ years. \r\n\r\n- Constant layoffs. Of course it doesn't hit every business unit or every group every time, but we are always doing \"Resource Actions.\"  As a manager, I have to constantly be prepared to submit names for upcoming RA's.  The RA's are NOT limited to low performers or areas where there has been a work reduction.  I'm supposedly in a growing part of the business, but the job growth is not in the US.  Despite what our CEO tells Trump or the media.\r\n\r\n- I like the new performance review system in theory, but in practice assessments were handled poorly in 2016. We were strong armed into decreasing employee's ratings without any explanation of why or what the expectations were for average or above average ratings.  There is a disconnect as my team is viewed as high performing, but I'm not permitted to give them high performing ratings.  \r\n\r\n- We are just wrapping up our bonus planning, which occurs once a year.  I was able to give 0.5%-1% bonuses to employees who were high performing.  It was the worst \"bucket\" I've ever seen, but not by much.  It's rare to get a bonus of more than a few thousand, no matter how good your results were.  Obviously, it's different for middle & upper management and for sales. \r\n\r\n- The scope of our jobs keeps changing and growing, because they lay off people and add those responsibilities to existing staff.  Currently, I'm doing the work that was spread across three people last year. (I was already pretty busy before this change). My story isn't unique.  There is little or no training when you are forced to assume responsibility for tasks that were previously not part of your job. \r\n\r\n- Lots of favoritism. I say this as someone who is seen as a top performer and a favorite! I've worked in four business units at IBM, and in each, upline management has a very obvious bias towards some employees and against others, which does not align with recent performance.   I also can't believe how much gossiping and in-fighting there is.  I get enough childishness from my children!  Who needs that at work?\r\n\r\n- The \"back to the office\" movement is in full swing, as well as forced relocation.  Yes, getting to work from home at all was a perk, not a right, but it was very transparent, especially in management calls, that this was done to encourage attrition.  Not enough people quit because of this policy, they are now doing layoffs. \r\n\r\n- Constant \"transformation\" churn. Every year, our execs decide they are going to reinvent the wheel when it comes to internal processes.  Every year we waste tens of thousands of man hours pursuing these \"transformation\" projects that never actually result in any significant changes.  I'd welcome transformation if our executives were genuinely interested in it instead of just holding many, many meetings to talk about needing to transform.  \r\n\r\n- \"IBM - I've Been Meeting\" - in management, you will spend the vast majority of time in meetings that could have been replaced with a quick email; meetings to discuss what to do in the other meeting about the same topic that day; etc.  We're terrible at collaborating.  Interestingly, despite so many meetings, most people I know at IBM have difficulty understanding and communicating what their organization's objectives and priorities are, as the information that trickles down from upper management is pretty limited.\r\n\r\n- Mentoring is talked about constantly, and yet maybe 5% of the people I know at IBM have a mentor.   To be fair, most people don't have the time.  Similarly, we used to have a robust talent program where the top 5-10% of employees were groomed for more senior roles.  This was dismantled and the replacement feels very much like \"you're on your own.\"",

    "Career advancement and recognition are almost non-existent relative to other divisions within IBM. Other IBM divisions are recognized for their accomplishments. RSUs, options and annual awards are the norm. These things are RARE in IBM Micro. This \"other division\" recognition is hard to swallow when you realize that it is your team's accomplishments that have SIGNIFICANTLY helped the other divisions succeed. An important but not immediately necessary IBM non-benefit is the lack of a retirement health plan for new employees. Plain and simple, there is none. This is a huge downside for IBM.",
    "Salary, Career Advancements, No Green Card Processing after 5/6 years, bureaucracy, Recognition is hard to come by. Indian policies are bueracractic. Seems they have dropped their bar as they compete with the lowest in the market.",
    "The bureaucracy. One feels like a tiny cog in a giant machine, reduced to one number: Billable utilization.",
    "Too much workload and cost reduction",
    "Increment and bonus is quite pathetic.\r\nCan be lost in a huge organization like this. \r\nThough opportunities are there competition is tough as well and you got to fight for it and sometimes its not always fair.\r\nWaste a lot of time dealing with the numerous systems and problems, tedious processes and sometimes long line of approvals.",

    "The environment while is professional and encouraging creativity may not be as whacky like Google.",
    "Very stressful and overly challenging, over-worked, unpaid overtime.",
    "I was with the company for 10 years and saw the culture erode signficantly from high employee morale to low. The job I took after leaving IBM was a 50% improvement in compensation and this isn't uncommon. The issue is that they've cut so much cost out of the business trying to march to their Earnings per Share roadmap that it has had a far reaching effect on the allowable operating expenditure of the various business units. This translates into promotions being few and far between, measly compensation and raises and extenuating circumstances required to attend education or conferences that involve travel. The culture is also quite hierarchical vs. collegial and egalitarian.",
    "no track for promotion or advancement",
    "They are laying off the older workers at an alarming rate to try and save the sinking ship. Makes sense to get rid of the people who actually did the work and keep those responsible for 18 quarters of losing money.",
    "the utilization target is high.  you need to achieve 93% in whole year.  it means you have to work OT to meet it.   And usually, you cannot take all of the vacation to meet your UT target.   \r\nThere is very few high level tasks in here.  Most of the tasks are low level like coding, internal deisgn.  it is one feature of out sourcing.    It is not a good place to improve your technical skill.  only needs"

A huge benefit is the company pension scheme, it's excellent and shows in my opinion a degree of class that is highlighted by company's infrastructure. \n\nHaving worked for other large optical multiples over 15 years I can honestly say my time with Boots Opticians so far has been a rewarding experience. There consistency of approach with there people is the real highlight of my time so far. As a Manager yes the buck stops and starts with you but that's Management, you have the autonomy to build and develop your own team and aim to deliver business objectives set by company and for the Boots brand whist leading customer healthcare as a focus at all times.\n\nA very pleasant alternative in comparison to the model set by other optical multiples who's focus is generally led by profit sharing with partnership creating in my opinion an inconsistent message and poor environment for employees that varies hugely from practice to practice depending on owners personal motivation.",

There is a huge wealth of knowledge contained within these personnel with all the skills already there to be developed further with ease but for some reason nobody ever seems to act on it properly. Instead the general approach tends to be to invest in external retail based candidates or pharmacy colleague's to lead and manage the practice's. All that really does is create a lack of empathy and understanding between colleagues.  \" it's easier to teach an optometrist retail than a retailer optometry \"\n\nThere is a real opportunity to invest in optometrists career journey in this company and differentiate themselves from there competitors as employer of choice. They are already beating others with pay structure and clinical environment, if they nail this they will be onto something special. \n\nP.s. I am not an optometrist",

May not be good for you if you require much support, that being said course and supervisory staff have been extremely helpful with this.",

  "cons": [
    "They strip out all digital marketing for themselves and train you to use expensive methods which last worked in the 90s. You are essentially responsible for producing revenue/fees. They restrict you from using many methods from developing business and essentially you are marketing their brand for free. If you leave, generally, they keep your clients due to high exit charges which mean you cannot advise them to leave.\r\n\r\nThey usually pay no salaries and all the risk and expense is borne by yourself as a wealth adviser. If they paid salaries their whole business model would break, essentially it has echos of the pyramid/MLM model of the 90s.\r\n\r\nThe other thing they like to do is absorb the client banks of smaller IFAs who join them."

    "dc managers communicate much better over the last year. Every day there is a briefing and every week there is a directors breifing and managers lsiten and act on what we say.\r\nPay is OK when you get different skills.\r\nI really like when managers take time to talk to me, making sure i am ok. its safe here",
    "Thanks for your reply Cromwell to my points.",
    "Leadership has greatly improved - care about team members and the customer, and are committed to Cromwell being a Great Place to Work\r\nOpportunities for those who contribute to the business and demonstrate the right positive behaviours\r\n(Mostly) passionate and like-minded colleagues\r\nFit for purpose business strategy\r\nInitiatives planned for the next 3 years, and beyond",
    "For those looking to be part of a great team look no further, I could not ask to be part of a better team.\n\nFor those willing to put in the effort Cromwell has plenty of opportunities and have always encouraged me through my progression.\n\nIf you are looking for a company with big intentions you have found it, Cromwell proactively plan for the future.",
    "Passion and hard working people, strong roots, customer loyalty",
    "Clear growth strategy based on keeping our customers' operations running their people safe.  Approachable and friendly Senior Leadership Team.  Clear and regular communications - town halls - weekly news.  Commitment to enabling Individual Personal Development.",
    "none really-such a shame! since the company was taken over back in 2015",
    "Engaging, Positive, Motivational, Challenging, Leadership, Protective, Innovative",
    "Had great people who loved their work",
    "Good to be part of this company",
    "Positive and supportive culture. Feel part of the team.  Clear strategy and understanding how to achieve our ambitions."
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Sometimes legacy issues continue to get raised when action has already been taken.",
    "None that I can think of currently",
    "Pockets of long standing colleagues who act as 'victims' and think of the 'good old days' through rose tinted glasses, stuck in their ways and bring about negativity\r\nMore demonstrable consequent management for those who don't perform or who are unprofessional",
    "In all honesty the only con I can think of is technology, although improved and still improving due to being an older business Cromwell is sometimes a little behind on technology but as I say that seems to be improving alot",
    "Change is necessary. But managing the change is equally necessary. Failing site of managing change with the poor communication is leading to key people leaving plus customers leaving. After all the change: what will you be left with? Such a shame as the position in marketplace was strong, work ethic was great and the core foundations for a strong enterprise in agile markets were there but amongst the desires and vision the company has lost site of what’s important it’s staff and it’s customers. Surprised Grainger have not picked up on this, nor hr. surely they have a role to play in questioning this.  Otherwise how are they being responsible stewards.  I did not leave as a result of these issues but due to personal circumstances but would have left due to all of these",
    "The IT and ERP needs an overhaul as this is stopping us getting to where we want to be.",
    "Too many to mention unfortunately.Company has changed beyond recognition and seems intent on sending their customers down the internet route",
    "I know that methods will change and people will have to adapt, but the problem is the staff were not given the plan. Having worked at  Cromwell for many years, seeing the 2 corner shops turn into a multi million £ turnover, it just seemed sad to see so many good staff leave. The high number does seem to indicate that there was something wrong in explaining how the changes would take place. The quality of staff they had (and still have) would surely have seen the light, if they were given a torch of hope. In the past how many staff left, very few. All though MG's 'ways' could well been now seen as out of date in this new world, but his enthusiasm pulled us all along. The one thing I don't want is for Cromwell to fail, as it would be a shame to lose the great customer base that was given and the great staff. The biggest problem was the staff did not know what was really happening, so this could not be explained to the customers. Again, I do hope Grainger/Cromwell do succeed, as it would be a testament to all those extra hours we all worked in the early days. I just feel the transition period could have done much better with more transparency, which would then have not produced all the negative reviews. Anyway good luck, and enjoy the ride.",
    "Since the takeover things rapidly declined. No focus on staff or customers only what returns the shareholders needed. Branches closed to pay the dividend.  Theyre like locusts they will close and sell any assets then sell the shell",
    "It is really busy. goods iin is very busy, with products constantly being pushed to the top of the list to keep availability right so you have to be able to work under pressure.\r\nPay is minimum wage if you only have one skill",
    "Nothing much just some unwanted politics & favourism which happen sometimes between manangement"

    "Great support from leadership team",
    "big break in spain every year",
    "Great people!\r\nFeel empowered to excel in your role\r\nLoads of development opportunities\r\nCross departmental movement\r\nGreat rewards and benefits",
    "Great management team, supportive colleagues and a dynamic can-do culture. I've worked for a number of companies and Access is up there with the very best. The way the firm has managed the Covid19 crisis has been exceptional",
    "Love Work Love Life Access",
    "Business Honesty is a real positive for access, they are open with their employees about how the company is doing. Granted there is some inherent biased towards this from my perspective as i have so far only experienced the company doing well. \r\nThe difference between Access and other companies from my experience is that with Access you can see the changes being made to continually adapt and grow within the market. \r\nThey respect and listen to their employees, might seem like a given but Access has really grasped the concept that their is a vital difference between a 'Manager' and a 'Leader'. \r\nOver recent years more and more companies have changed to the same approach as socialised programs in that a certain Post is aligned with a certain set salary or hourly rate irrelevant of the productive output of each individual.\r\nDefinitely a positive for me is that Access have not followed this path, they have stuck to the core principle of how a business actually works as opposed to a Utopian view that everyone should be paid the same regardless of productivity. So with Access the more productive you are is directly reflected by pay increases and bonuses. \r\nAs mentioned they are focused on providing a quality leadership for employees and this again is not just a tag line, working day to day within the Access group is a pleasant and relaxed experience, i personally feel comfortable asking for assistance from both colleagues and big wigs. \r\n\r\nOverall i would definitely recommend Access as a place to work for people from all levels of experience. They are willing to invest time and money into individuals to train them so don't let a lack of technical knowledge hold you back.",
    "Staff are nice and friendly",
    "Good salary\r\nGreat loyalty perks\r\nDecent working hours",
    "Fantastic Working Environment/Culture\r\nAutonomy and Flexibility within Role\r\nTransparency of Business Results and Long Term Business Plan\r\nAgile Business Going Places\r\nGreat Team Ethic \r\nCompetitive Reward Packages",
    "You are expected to work hard but supported throughout. Salaries are competitive, benefits are great! Personally I know if I continue to work hard I will be rewarded and believe the company will support me with my career progression.",
    "I'm really impressed with the way Access have dealt with COVID19, we were all working from home within 48 hours and just recently a few of our offices opened on a phased approach. Staff were asked to volunteer to assist with this programme, whilst the rest of us carried on 'business as usual' from home. \r\n\r\nWe are kept up to date with regular video messages from our Board of Directors and I have a daily video meeting with my team (which have certainly kept my spirits up). \r\n\r\nI'm proud to be working for such a vibrant and forward thinking company and am looking forward to what the future brings."

    "There are no Cons at Access",
    "Management are highly political, sales driven, no growth, salary rise",
    "As Access continues to grow and turn a profit it is a given that the top dogs will want to keep acquiring a greater market share. My only concern about this is that if this continues at the current pace the quality of the overall service we provide will suffer. Of course as an employee i want the company to keep growing but at the same time i do feel we should master the services we already offer and make sure existing customers receive the type of service we claim to offer.",

    "No career advancement, the person next you to could be paid $10k+ more to be doing the same job( and often more poorly) no performance management of poor performing staff members, mid level managers vs the team members it’s very ‘us and them’, not transparent or clear communication/ information provided - our particular office was fueled by rumours, people often get jobs internally who are not qualified for them, reward and recognition program was basically non-existent, the  structure across teams who primarily did the same job were different so some teams would have more support than others, constantly understaffed and temps are not the answer. Also if you ‘wrong’ people in HR your career with suffer - so discrimination is prevalent and the wrong people have power.",
    "Too many organizational changes; This is causing turnover, distraction and lack of sales.",
    "Modest compensation and benefits, periodical OT",
    "Political. Low pay. Lack of clarity in performance review and promotion.",
    "We work as Shared service team. We are dependent on onshore team for lending any work.",
    "I worked at Mercer for a little over 2 years in Benefit Outsourcing.   This line of business is not doing well for Mercer and has been on a 5 year plan to turn a profit or to fold.  This is probably year 3 of that plan and it's not going well.  So many people have quit and those that are left have to do the jobs of 2 or 3 people.  Management is the worse I have ever seen.  I have worked for Corporate American for many years and this particular line of business is a disaster.   I had two managers during this two plus years and never met either of them.  RUN AWAY!!",

    "Compensation package, constant change in leadership",
    "Lack of competitive pay in the Bay Area",
    "Nothing, everything is amazing so far!",
    "Senior management is a big mystery. The CEO never communicates to anyone (because she should be the CFO not the CEO). Many of the long-service people have left or have been fired.  They are taking us on a journey somewhere, but they haven't told us where we're going. Not as much fun as it used to be.",
    "Onboarding of employees is a bit disjointed",
    "Shift hours are not flexible",
    "The investment consulting team did not really seem to care about their jobs all that much. Wasn't a very lively working environment.",

    "There is not much of creativity needed working in a marketing job. You should always go back to what have done before and do similar things because the direction is to build on what satisfied customers.",
    "The pay is horrible. They overwork you and do not pay enough.  They take advantage and do not care about employees.",
    "Not enough staff creates stressful environment and NO work/life balance. Far too much organizational change..confusing. Not always a meritocracy. Information overload daily. Salaries not to market.",
    "There is a complete lack of communication top down on strategy. You tend to get good news 3/4 of the year, and suddenly in the 4th, there is bad news, in time for the increments and bonuses :) Another con is the politics, its very bad at the middle and top tier. The compensation and redundancy policies lacks much to be desired, and are not matching the market, despite Mercer being a HR consultancy",
    "there is some inflexibility in terms of changes",
    "the teams are all on the same plateau when it comes to decision-making.   this can make it tough for one team to take charge and really drive a project.",
    "Not paid enough for what is put on employees",
    "Does not seem to be anyone looking out for you from the top down.  SOME people operate as \"lone wolfs\", only seem to care about their billable hours and sales goals.",
    "Comp and advancement can be slow.",
    "Tools and software are outdated\r\nNo clear objectives, project management non-existent\r\nFew opportunities to learn\r\nOffices are spread widely, making communication slow and inefficient",
    "There are no cons if you are hardworking enough",
    "low increment, less chance of growth in the long run",
    "Uninspired work sometimes and getting caught up on the little things can be annoying as well",
    "No Onsite opportunities or minimal onsite",
    "Management appears to prioritize short-term profit over all other objectives. They say that their people are their most valuable asset, but this does not always ring true in the way in which they manage their people. There are regional/office differences here though - I think some offices with better leaders are far better places to work.",
    "Yearly pay increases, emphasis on billable hours",
    "Very Centralised mentality, American dictatorship style, US suppliers, Service-Now, Shared Services, and how all of their Global decision have negative impacts for some of our the distinct regions.",
    "Not sure that management has a clear vision for how to move forward",
    "Sometimes over commitment with project work leads to stress",
    "Work/Life balance is not great.",
    "As many large organizations, it is a political environment - learn how to navigate politics if you want to become Principal/Partner\r\nCollaboration challenges - find your little team/sponsors to get work/opportunities",

    "Salary below market, few promotions",
    "Too large, impersonal at times",

    "Can be slow to make change",
    "A lot of complacent people lacking drive. Skill sets are inconsistent across different skill sets. Feedback is not given in a productive way.",
    "If you're part of an acquisition, it seems impossible to bring your salary up to current levels of legacy colleagues of the the same job level",
    "This company has no believable mission, which is clear by the sarcastically pessimistic rumblings of the employees.  Their Benefits division is failing, and they are not doing much to revitalize it.  This makes sense since they make their bread and butter in the consulting business, but it is not a place for a driven person to work.",
    "- Cliques, some people were horrible and will throw you under the bus to save their own skin, copying managers and leaders in emails to intimidate you \r\n- micromanagement is encouraged\r\n- promote people with no previous management experience\r\n- many good leaders and employees have been laid off or left for better opportunities \r\n- layoffs ever quarter, more at year end\r\n- little or no diversity\r\n- personal lunches were half eaten or fully eaten if left in the fridge, recommend everyone keep their lunch at their desk\r\n- people of color are treated BAD, openly heard employees making racist remarks in kitchen\r\n- if you’re LGBT, you’re treated WORST....openly heard a female manager make condescending remarks to gay male in a staff meeting",

    "There is very little upward movement",
    "Average salaries. Salary structure does not reward enough for performance or value.",
    "Inconsistent growth opportunities that vary by region and by practice",
    "1.  You get lumped into a massive category of people so it is practically impossible to stand out\r\n2.  Rewards have gotten less and less each year\r\n3.  Rewards system has gotten more complex each year so you are not even sure in the end what you can do to earn the bonus\r\n4.  They restrict their salary increases for internal applicants.  If you move internally to a new position you are capped at a certain salary increase whereas someone coming from the outside for the same position can potentially make more.  This is a major discouragement to stay and grow with the company.",
    "Can be a sink or swim environment, highly competitive which is sometimes unhealthy, filled with strong type As who sometimes come across as extremely aggressive if you're not a strong type A, not as much leadership and guidance, company seems to always be changing senior management and goals which can make you feel lost and like a tiny fish in the sea",
    "Salary not competitive versus marketplace",
    "Pay is not competitive. Also, they make anyone and everyone become a manager at one point to get promoted to a higher level. I've seen people who are very technical who contributed to the company immensely without taking a management role, but they put it in one of the steps to get promoted and it has failed miserably. The manager quit along with a lot of the team members that were being managed. Some people can take on multiple roles if it fit their skillets, but it shouldn't be a requirement - or there should be exceptions.",
    "low competitive reward, slow career path",

    "Great place to work and talented people",
    "the lower ranks have a bond specifically when working overseas",
    "- Highly respective of diversity\r\n - Senior Management very open to mentoring and advice\r\n - Highly skilled colleagues\r\n - Great benefits and pension package\r\n - Immense diversity in job options available - because of huge geographical spread so each role is like a new job\r\n - A genuinely good company with genuinely good people\r\n - Superb work-life balance",
    "Variety, pace structure values and safety culture",
    "BP is not just an Oil company, but its an energy company, it has global reach hence great career prospects for professionals, salaries are good, very systematic organization, strong culture of Health, Safety & Environment and most importantly, believe in 'Quality work'",
    "Good people, interesting engineering, pushing for renewables",
    "talented people, excellent work/life balance, good salary, good benefit package",
    "Nice staff\r\nGood pay\r\nHalf price M&S food for lunch",
    "Decent salary for employees in BP",

    "Consistent  shift cycle with regular days off",
    "Was decent like good hours",
    "Pay, perks and benefits",
    "good opportunity to learn and develop at the job"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Culture not collaborative enough. Poor support for ideation.",
    "Very complex organization to understand - interfaces are complex and scattered all around the world.",
    "Future of oil is uncertain",
    "rigid structure, difficult to change positions or get an expat",
    "Completely inhumane working place. Terrible office. V little parking once you get inside no privacy no place to sit and collect your thoughts. People stuffed in the building like chickens. If you are sick or pregnant no guidelines from company no place to take a break no one will help you! People dont talk to each other just work like robots. No communication",
    "Lots of change while it transitions into a new energy company - however there will be lots of opportunities",
    "too much bureaucracy and procedures",
    "Bad pay and the training is difficult",
    "barriers to enter trading area, exams and more competition",
    "Freezing cold in store all year round",
    "8 months after start  they closed the shop",
    "Too much physical work in any given shifts.",
    "- slothful HR (but thats the case everywhere!)\r\n - Policies and Processes keep changing before there is a chance to settle down\r\n - High reliance on consultants to come up with a new strategy everytime a new leader of a division comes in.  Consultants dont put their money where their mouth is.  So things keep changing every few years (read: above comment)\r\n - Focus on 'change' to showcase leadership rather than 'silent running' and 'stability'\r\n - slow salary growth after joining (my peers in consulting firms get 20% pa raises compared to 4-6% I get)\r\n - Negative impression of the company after the Macondo incident (though I strongly blv that BP is a genuinely good company - much better than its other supermajor peers)",

    "Mmmm where to start???? They will happily have staff working 60 hours a week, they don't pay people correctly, eg not at correct rate, not for correct number of hours, sometimes both or not at all! Wages department treat you with contempt when you do question it.... that's if they get around to answering your phone call.... Oh yeah, you dont even receive a pay slip sometimes so v difficult to actually see where they've made the mistakes! They bang on about \"Person Centeredness\" like they invented it but do little to model this ethos, eg, managers will ammend care plans to reflect what is best for the company, NOT for the service users they claim to put at the centre of their own care. If Staff try to stand up for their own, or the Service Users' rights they are quickly stamped on by Managers. Safeguarding issues brought to Managers' attention are also dismissed. It goes on and on, which is why i left, and why I wrote to the CQC about them. Them simply must be stopped because they are not fit for purpose.",
    "Lack of support to staff, unprofessional management, ill desicion making and staff drink alcohol on site (including deputy line managers), as well as condoning the use of drugs by residents, ridiculous hours of work, and staff usually come in late making you wait usually up to thirty mins frequently, and they say they reimburse additional costs to be placed at bolton services but in reality thats a lie.",
    "Support workers are not receiving sufficient training and development. Very little supervision in place.",
    "Bullying in central management is rife. Inexperienced managers are given no training and therefore they have no clue how to treat their staff. The Chief Executive is irrational, erratic and hysterical and can blow up with no notice. Business is won by undercutting on price with no thought for innovation or whether the service can be delivered. HR staff are overworked and under-trained - none have CIPD training and often they have to wing it. The support I got while bullied was well-meaning but useless.",
    "Extremely negative CEO - talks down to, belittles and shouts at staff across an open plan office at HQ\r\nBlame culture within organisation\r\nAppalling staff retention rates that means staff are constantly having to absorb extra roles and consistently overstretched and burnt out\r\nGenuine concern about the rate of growth of the organisation without the resources to support such growth and the impact on the standards of care for service users\r\nTerrible pay \r\nNo performance management or support for employees\r\nLack of career development",
    "Management haven’t got a clue",
    "Awful pay and support from management. Always understaffed . terrible moral generally",
    "Greatly underpaid for the responsibility I had. Tried on numerous occasions to get my salary in line with the industry standard to no avail. Staff, in general are underpaid for what they do",

  "pros": [
    "Having previously worked at another UK high street bank in a corporate role I agreed to join Metro Bank because of the AMAZEING culture that is being built by the management team and all colleagues. The people really make this as a business. Everyone has a can do attitude and a willingness to do what is right for the customer. After 8 years of 'No we cant do that, it is outside of policy' the two to say no attitude is very refreshing. I have worked in the business for 18 months now and all colleagues have been very welcoming from day 1. The facilities within the business are excellent with investment clearly made in property. Management are very supportive of development opportunities and plans are clearly structured to help you progress through the business.",
    "There is a strong emphasis on a really positive culture at Metro. People really do try to help each other out.",
    "I have worked for metro bank for 5 years and I can honestly say that there is no other company quite like it. It's a fun filled environment bringing laughter to the table.",
    "Everyone is really nice to each other.",
    "Constantly growing business which creates a lot of opportunities but as someone else mentioned, Metro Bank is not the right place for passengers. If you are looking to progress, you need to work for it, it won't just be handed to you because you have done your time, and unfortunately a lot of ppl join because they think they will get promoted quickly. there are so many great opportunities within the bank. As long as you work hard for it. Craig is an amazing asset to Metro. I have never worked for a bank before but I can tell you, his involvement with all of the colleagues across the business is great. How many ppl can say they see their CEO actively involved in the business day in and day out. His passion is admirable. His dedication to Metro Bank is amazing and inspirational. I consider myself lucky to be working with him.",
    "The people and team are great, loads of opportunity for growth if you know the right people",
    "Working with fun people with good atmosphere",
    "Amazing work culture and great opportunities for progression",
    "Great people at all levels of the company - joining Metro Bank is like joining a family and everyone is supportive of each other and has a great time together. You also feel like you're part of something pretty amazing.",
    "Good learning Opportunities and benefits",
    "The community\r\nThe culture\r\nThe people\r\nThe values",
    "Friendly , Fun loving and good to work",
    "Fast, growing company with opportunities to progress fast",
    "the people were really good",
    "Nurturing\r\nAllows progression and encourages it also",
    "Good start.\r\nQuick detailed training, with chances to learn more.\r\nPay is average for certain areas.",
    "Metro bank is one of the best places I've worked so far. Several opportunities to grow and develop within the bank with support if you need it. Honestly I've not met even one colleague who was not helpful in any store or department.",
    "The culture of putting customers first is so important and must be maintained. Our customers love our professional, friendly and knowledgeable service. We don't get commission or any sales targets. We just do whats right for the customer.\r\n\r\nOur 'Bump it up' mentality is amazing (being able to ask anyone, anywhere in the company for help) and must carry on. These allow us to best serbe our customers and change silly banking rules. This is what sets us apart from the competition.\r\n\r\nWorking in store is generally very relaxed. The colleagues you work with have a similar mentality of friendliness (I do question some people's ability in the job however).\r\n\r\nThe progression is good. New stores are opening all the time so new positions open up all the time. Theres opportunity to move to other departments too.\r\nThere are many courses you can get on to to expand your role. \r\nThere are fast track programmes to business managers etc.\r\n\r\nPrivate pension, health cover, 2nd opinion on doctors, Bike2work, free opticians, free flu shots, Vitality, cheap gym membership, Share scheme. All very good and helps a lot.",
    "Friendly\r\nGood culture\r\nAmazing colleague\r\nCan shadow teams\r\nGood experience with difficult customers",
    "Metro LIVE IT Operation is a fantastic place work, we have a robust structure and great leadership. \r\nThe help and support we provide each other is really amazing."
  ],
  "cons": [
    "We support 24/7 hence we can get overwhelmed with hours we do but that is the nature of managing and supporting LIVE Operations",
    "Have to work weekends sadly",
    "It’ll finding its feet with some processes, but there’s a real push for continuous improvement. It’s great to be a part of helping develop the bank!",
    "underpaid, the culture is very cringe, reminds me of being in kindergarten",
    "Pay could be better however recognition is rewarding. Often times recognition comes through promotion, which is good but grant bigger pay increases",
    "None so far to say",
    "Very fast paced company so you always have to make sure that you are up to speed and are able to keep up with the constant changes.",
    "Pay isn't great for the amount of work you do. My role emcompasses so many aspects that £21,000 a year really doesn't reflect the amount of work put in. You start on 23 days holiday per year but for a bank that's open 362 days of the year that is comparatively less than other banks.\r\n\r\nRotas are horrendous (comes down to management). Some rotas I believe are just copied and pasted, some don't give you the correct days off and there are fast ball changes all the time. We would hold events that are planned weeks in advance but we would still be scrounging for volunteers the day before.\r\n\r\nStaffing levels are not great. Many times I have had to double hat running back and forth doing different duties. This is while I already have a heavy work load helping other customers on pending cases.\r\nCustomers often get mad when the queue is long and only 1 cashier will be serving. Managers are supposed to sign onto a till but this rarely happens.",
    "Bad management store manager doesn't really care shifts not flexible",
    "Things change pretty quickly, so you have to move quickly to keep up, but the upside is that it makes the work really interesting.",
    "none that i can think of",
    "Stressful, Timings, growth, flexibility, support",
    "More focus required on peoples career",
    "Like every other bank they are slow.",
    "Lack of showers for colleagues in stores outside of Holborn head office. Would be good to promote healthy living for all colleagues and showers would allow people to run or cycle to work. \r\n\r\nAdditional resources needed for central teams due to continually expanding nature of business.",
    "Unpaid overtime is expected due to workload.\r\nManagement is out of touch and frankly most lower management is awful. No understanding of systems and highly variable expectations of staff.\r\nRandom work hours making work life balance a difficulty.\r\nFake culture that seems to be failing across the company.\r\nPay is low when compared to what you will actually be doing.",
    "no progression\r\nlong and anti social hours",
    "Severely underpaid. Other companies pay more for the same job title",
    "Only real con I would say is that they need more staff to accomodate customers so we can create more fans!",
    "Low salaries most times below what other companies will pay for the same role"

    "So many negatives for this company. Surveys that was being filled up by customers about the company is used as basis of the performance of the employees. I bet you customers did not know that. It's a miserable company that don't pay the right wages. They wanted freebies from their employees",

    "A few downsides to working at American Express are: 1) the call center environment can be an absolute nightmare (like most call centers) while I was working there I developed so much stress that I gained 70 pounds in a year and some other serious health conditions including heart-burn, depression, anxiety and back pain (the chair they provide you can be very uncomfortable) 2) Your leaders say that they care about you, that they think about you and how they can help you and that they \"don't care about the numbers\" and that they \"just want to make sure you are happy here\" but that's a total lie, my wife and I both worked there and we both had the same experience, Team Leaders that would tell you one thing and then talk about you behind your back. They would say how great you're doing and then complain to their leaders about how their team doesn't do well. So all in all the leadership could be better. 3) Trying to get promoted or move to a different department is near to impossible. I knew people that had been \"on the floor\" for 3+ years and had been trying to get into a different department but couldn't. Let's just say it pays to have friends in high places at American Express.",
    "There honestly aren’t any cons.",
    "The call flow is really bad. You're literally working all day long unless you're at lunch or a paid break. It used to be a little better.",

    "I do not have too much concerns",
    "Not the best paid job",
    "Decision is very hard to archive. Too many cooks.",
    "On-boarding experience didn't exist, one morning of discussions and nothing else.  Definitely a meeting driven culture.  Job rotations occur every 18 months which is fantastic for learning new skills, but means a lot of rework is done across teams as if you haven't just moved, someone else you're working with has, is about to, or joined with you.",

    "-can have a lot of politics \r\n-favoritism can play a part when it comes time for a new role\r\n-reorgs often which can be discouraging or confusing\r\n-comp is below industry average (but you do get much better work life balance)",
    "Environment can be more lively",
    "Very aggressive growth targets for existing customers",
    "Old school thinking (HR and leaders) with hierarchy that can limit available talent in house",
    "Benefits have been cut beyond a point that is reasonable, Overall Compensation is poor, executives continue to take increased pay whilst workforce having cuts."

    "Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, I have been continuously wowed at how important 'doing the right thing' really is to Taylor Wimpey. \r\n\r\nEmployees and customers have consistently been at the forefront of decisions made by our senior leaders. This was clear from the start of this uncertain time when they made the decision to be the first housebuilder to shut our sites when no one else was brave enough, right through to the discount that is now being offered to NHS staff/keyworkers in order to show our thanks. \r\n\r\nAs an employee who was furloughed I have consistently been kept updated and engaged with what is happening in the business, both through my immediate team mates and the wider communications shared by our CEO. \r\n\r\nI am really proud and extremely grateful to work for a company that consistently surprises me (in a good way) and is always trying to do, not what is easy, but what is right!",
    "A great place to work - focussed on conducting business in the right way with all our customers and employees at the heart of everything we do. A business that is a vehicle for all your ambitions.",

    "Easy to fit into schedule, I can sit at the desk and do homework while on the job. Nothing extremely taxing and does not hinder my studies",
    "You get to be outside all day.\r\nYou work for one of the best Universities in the nation.\r\nYou get to learn a lot about horticulture.",
    "Lots of learning experience.\r\nGood benefits",
    "The benefits are rather amazing. Matching with the 403(b) plan is twice the amount you put in up to 5% of your salary, giving you a de facto 10% pay increase from your stated salary. The healthcare is incredible in both it's access to superior doctors and facilities, as well as its affordability. I would highly recommend most people with a significant other working in the general area to pick up at job for the University Hospital System just to get the health and dental.",

  "cons": [
    "Always short staffed \r\nNurses were overworked and tended to talk about about one another openly and other patient care techs\r\nManagement was not flexible in their scheduling \r\nRacial discriminatory behavior was observed daily\r\nThere was not a day where the staff did not complain about the current work environment.",

    "Spending all day in lab environment",
    "Very far, a lot of people and students to work with every day, can't remember all students and colleagues at once, very big place",
    "The variation in students' capacities is significant. Cannot get good evaluations if you teach introductory classes. Other than that, there isn't much negative about it. Sometimes you cannot teach the class you really want to teach.",
    "Nothing that comes to my mind.",
    "Not the most professional environment, people do not always handle themselves in the most professional matter.",
    "Nothing is not good here",
    "Most staff working in the hospital proper act in a shell-shocked manner, as if they've had to live through some drastic event. This is primarily because of the poor, condescending management at both the middle and upper levels in the Ann Arbor hospital. Ancillary functions such as sanitation, food services, and some lab support functions (especially the IRB) are abysmally run as well, leading to stressful and protracted approval or processing or just a sad working environment overall. Management often seems more concerned with getting their names attached to projects or small incremental improvements than managing well.",
    "It really nice working there",
    "The overall culture of UM supports the idea that the bare minimum is enough.",
    "Not always great to work with student athletes, who are required to get help by their managers.",
    "the pay is not that high",
    "Nothing I can think of",
    "Poor management, Benefits get picked at each year (decreased raises, decreased percentage for matching), higher employee contribution.  Management has a disconnect on jobs and people skills",
    "You must be an early riser! \r\nYou are working in all kind of conditions, which means hot, hot summer days in July.",
    "Not much advancement, lots of turnover save for administrative staff",
    "As in most universities, everyone is relaxed and everything is slow. You may wait months before you will get the software or hardware you requested."

With so much extra training, long working hours, extra responsibility in carrying weapons and the obvious danger that entails, this should be addressed as for me personally, this was the main reason I departed for brighter shores-I literally was struggling to make ends meet.

    "This was my first job just after turning 16, and it left a horrible taste so to speak. It started off great, having been raised with LEGO with Danish family roots I had high expectations. I was blissfully unaware of how much harassment I was getting until later on.\r\n\r\nMy first day of \"training\" (Which was just silence in the back room while taking a digital online training course) I was privy to seeing my assistant manager barge into the back room, raging mad, and kicking/throwing boxes down the back hall. This was not uncommon later on, he was constantly raging due to interactions with customers.\r\n\r\nWithin the first 2 weeks of working there, red flags were already popping up. One female co-worker constantly and purposefully ignored me, only ever talking to me when she wanted me to do her work instead of herself, or if she wanted to poke fun at me for being a vegetarian. Another female co-worker (who was later promoted to supervisor) made the remark of \"I'm going to whip out my [male genitalia] and smack you with it.\" (reminder, I was a minor at the time and this woman was mid-twenties.) The co-workers were very cliquey and would take any chance they could to exclude me.\r\n\r\nOne co-worker turned supervisor, reported me and 2 other of my co-workers for having a conversation about Star Wars because she had no knowledge of the subject and took offense to that.\r\n\r\nMy hellish manager, constantly pretended to hit or kick me, admitted openly that he used me as a scapegoat, and tried to embarrass me on any possible occasion.\r\n\r\nAmong many other harassment and mistreatment instances that I'm unable to recall at the moment, they also all partook in violation of company policies, such as:\r\n\r\nDiscluding me from Christmas decorating by sending me home; Making me change very high lightbulbs on a wobbly ladder without supervision; Stealing bricks and minifigs; Intentionally damaging sets from shipments so they could then purchase said sets at a discounted price; Using inappropriate language in the store and back room; Having inappropriate music playing in the back room; Having inappropriate screensavers on company phones left lying in the store; and more.\r\n\r\nAside from my store itself, I also dealt with mistreatment from Corporate. I had reported my co-workers for how they were behaving and corporate investigated. They ended up telling me nobody had broken any rules, nobody would be fired, that I was a liar, that nobody was harassing me, and that I was the one causing problems. Even though I had been tearing up while conversing with them and I was a minor at 16, they did nothing. I quit promptly on the spot a few minutes later.\r\n\r\nAside from my personal experiences I was also told stories by co-workers of people who worked there prior to me:\r\n\r\nOne old employee urinated in another co-worker's drinking cup because they had ticked him off; Another employee had called 'dibs' on girls who he said were 'gonna be hot when they're older'; another used to hit on all the Asian girls who came in including one of the co-workers.\r\n\r\nI also had co-workers and supervisors  who quit from mistreatment. A newer co-worker had also commented on how it seemed everyone constantly bullied me.\r\n\r\nAbout 7 months later I heard that a new store was opening in San Francisco, and I thought it could be a fresh start. I wrote to my old regional manager and got the go ahead to apply. I applied, got a call back maybe the next day and the manager I spoke with loved my prior experience and was ready to offer me a supervisor position, he said he'd be in touch after checking with my last manager to see what he had to say about me. About a few days later there was a job fair for the store so I dropped by and left my application with the people there as well who also loved my prior experience and such, and they too wanted to see what my previous manager had to say about me. They told me to watch for a call in the next couple of days. I never heard from any of them again, even after writing an email to them to check up on the hiring process.",
    "The working environment is great.",
    "There can be some pressure at times (not as bad as most places though!), and you probably won't be able to get access to any type of truly fun job (to make a career of like being a  builder, etc) from working in a retail store.",
    "As is the same with many larger organisations, LEGO employees have had to deal with a lot of uncertainty in the last few years due to corporate restructuring.",
    "If you do not think you can handle working with lots of children and parents angry at the high prices do not apply for a job here.",
    "Need to be more mindful of communication from CM,  core messages can be lost in the downward cascade.\r\nFace needs to fit if you want progress \r\nDiversity, what exactly is the strategy, promoting employees into senior roles when they are not ready to meet targets.\r\nSome employees are allowed to get away with very poor behaviour",
    "A children's store managed by a corporate office full of children"

Principals assign work to favorites and not necessarily the person that needs work or that even brought the project in. \r\n\r\nMake sure you document your work as you can expect managers and above to take credit for your work without any recognization",

    "- flexible working hours\r\n- company case for their employees\r\n- opportunities to get promoted and build a career",
    "Provides great flexibility for students and having a negotiated contract really adds a sense of security. Progression is relatively easy as long as you're competent and able to adapt when the shift gets busy.",
    "Good staff very fun to work there",
    "Flexible Hours\r\nAlways Busy - shifts go quickly\r\nGood staff perks",
    "- Lots of paid breaks with food!\r\n- Good company values\r\n- Lively and positive atmosphere\r\n- Time flies on a busy shift!\r\n- Patraos (General Managers) are generally great, friendly and helpful with a few exceptions."
  ],
  "cons": [
    "- staff changes a lot \r\n- the atmosphere depends a lot on the management",
    "Can be stressful at times\r\nCan be antisocial hours",
    "Nothing was a very good job to work at",
    "Supervisor role is tremendously underpaid. Currently, the wage is £9.33 with delays to increase in per hour pay 'due to the covid situation'. However, when you're getting approx 60p more than national for having to run a restaurant, opening, closing and being responsible for covid safety - it's safe to say that it is far from worth it. Also, supervisors tend to carry the burden for when things aren't right, it is very rarely the upper manager's fault and always disciplined to you first.",
    "- Like I said, it is let down by supervisors and assistant managers who are lazy and have big egos!\r\n- Also pay is not great, it is similar to waitering pay but without tips so not good! Much lower than pay in other kitchens too!\r\n- Can be pretty intense shifts when busy but you get used to it."

  "_id": "Unity-Technologies",
  "pros": [
    "Autonomy, exciting technology, relaxed and respectful culture. Focus on building the best in class solutions.",
    "- A fun place to work. People are very nice and approachable. This is the best part about Unity.\r\n- Food is pretty good but if you work late they don't provide dinner. \r\n- Snack quality is declining but it's there. \r\n- Paid health insurance. 100 bucks wellness benefits and 401k matching.\r\n- Work life balance is pretty good if you end up on the right team.",
    "Great culture and innovative work.",
    "Great salary, paid lunches.\r\nWork-from-home twice a week.",
    "Catered lunch, 100 bucks wellness benefits, 15 days PTO, 9 sick days, 5 float days.",
    "The company has the potential to make it big but most overcome its toxic culture before it can get there.",
    "Amazing product vision trajectory, great benefits with fully stock kitchens and daily free lunches. I definitely feel spoiled working here, all while being part of a disruptive and exciting industry.",
    "Flexible company with good people and good culture.",
    "I never thought I would find a job that I love so much! \r\n- Snacks and weekly meals are provided\r\n- Social events\r\n- personal development\r\n- Yoga & in-house massages\r\n- great management & colleagues \r\n- beautiful, modern workspace\r\n- flexible working hours (to an extent)\r\n- flat structure! Everyone’s equal and has something important to offer",
    "I kind of fell into Unity on my way out of the VFX industry. It's like night and day... a work environment that fosters creativity and technical excellence, but understands that the goal is to get tools into artists hands. The \"democratizing game development\" philosophy comes from inside Unity and is practiced daily at all levels. \r\n\r\nI've never been treated so well as an employee.",
    "Some of the core values Unity tries to embrace are \"Best Idea Wins\", \"Go Bold\" and \"In It Together\". I've worked at many companies whose values are allegedly good, but don't actually take action on them. In contrast, Unity seems to really invest in these ideas. They deliver Active Listening training to leaders. They have a whole range of social events. They even have an entire Wellbeing team dedicated to running clubs and socials, sending gifts, and so on (so these responsibilities don't fall on the shoulders of people who are juggling this with other work)! They also have several Employee Resource Groups for people in marginalised groups (like a BIPOC one, an LGBTQ+ one, a women's ERG, and so on). Sustainability is also a core concern, with much discussion and events happening around that.\r\n\r\nEvery team is managed differently, so your experience may vary, but I am given lots of freedom to shape my job to fit myself, rather than change myself to fit the role. I can explore different technologies, collaborate across the organisation, and get involved in a wide variety of work.\r\n\r\nThe work is interesting and generously compensated (both in terms of salary and holiday allowance); the people are brilliantly smart, talented, and excellent listeners; and the technology is cutting-edge and exciting to work with. It's the most positive and inspirational workplace I've ever had the pleasure of working at.",
    "Exciting prospects for the future.",
    "empowering, smart people. fun, challenging, self-driven",
    "Even with all the recent growth Unity is still in it's infancy of ideas, processes and systems. So joining the company allows you to utilize all your strengths and truly make an impact. Plus the visibility that leadership provides into the direction of the company is refreshing. I've never seen C-Suite leaders openly engage in discussion/debate with all employees about product ideas, roadmap etc. Keep it up!",
    "- Intelligent people (with great sense of humor)\r\n- Lunch and snacks included\r\n- Interesting projects\r\n- Flexible work hours with capability to work from home 2 days a week"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Not much, so far so good.",
    "Employees who can take charge and work well from their own initiative will thrive here. Unity does not operate with the rigid constraints and processes you may find at other large organizations. This may be challenging to some people who look for a more structure.",
    "Politics heavy and constant organizational shifts.",
    "The process of getting code into the final product can sometimes be frustrating, but the end result is usually better quality, so in the end, it's worth it.",
    "Compensation and Merit (totals) and process is okay but needs improvement.",
    "Upper management seems to be currently shifting/changing, and these moves affect the concentration and focus of their direct teams.",
    "Sometimes too many meetings, especially during the pandemic (as it's a big organisation).\r\n\r\nIf you're not from a corporate background, the jargon can be off-putting. There is a jargon glossary though!\r\n\r\nMany different systems for different tasks. Not a huge problem, just a lot to learn when you first arrive.\r\n\r\nSometimes things are moving so fast, it feels as if we haven't finished one product/solution before we're working on or shipping the next one, which can damage credibility with users (e.g. if something ships with bugs)",
    "- Filter out all the fake reviews that are obviously posted by recruiters trying to bank some commission. There are lots of them and they are not accurate portrayal of what's going on inside Unity.\r\n\r\n- Low caliber talent pool. Unity is desperate for coders and the hiring bar has suffered as a result of that. It's hard to count on people to get their stuff done. \r\n\r\n- Performance review is extremely unstructured. It's very hard to take perf review seriously at Unity. Whatever you say will go unnoticed and it seems to have no effect towards compensation.\r\n\r\n- Low caliber managers. Anyone .... literally anyone can become a manager at Unity. If you want a 'lead' title, Unity shall provide. If you suck, no worries there is no consequence. You can always revert back to IC.\r\n\r\n- Last but not least, if you are financially motivated. This is not the place for you. No target bonus. Compensation change is rare and stock package is a joke.",
    "Long hours and insane expectations. Office is mostly empty after 5P but Slack is active 24/7. Comparable to working at an investment bank. \r\n\r\nI wish I could give 0 star for work/life balance.",
    "- On boarding is minimal\r\n- People you work with may not be local (long distance communication)",
    "none, none, none, none, none",
    "With so much growth there has been a certain level of friends hiring friends. While referrals are great if too much overlap is done when hiring it can start to create an alienating environment for others.",
    "- Management hires and rewards their \"own people\", e.g. ones they worked with at previous companies, e.g. EA. Favoritism is widespread and a big reason why many talented people are leaving.\r\n- Company values are BS and not implemented nor demonstrated by management in any credible way.\r\n- The company claims to be inclusive, flat, and bottom-up, but it clearly has a shadow structure of people who are making top-down decisions.\r\n- Sexism is prevalent.\r\n- The Old Guard holds too much power and is unwilling to accept new ideas coming from others, e.g. new hires.\r\n- The strategy is all over the place and completely devoid of focus. \r\n- Code quality is alarmingly bad. \r\n- Comp is a joke and has been an issue for ages.",
    "I had no feeling of belonging to a team, at Unity. Few developers actually coded, most just did code reviews and complained on the internal chat tool. Then, there was the dark, cave-like work environment and the 10-minutes lunches. Finally, the company starts duplicate projects in different cities and puts them in competition against each other.",
    "I genuinely have no cons"

Lack of support for study from engagement managers - many instances of not being given the timetabled study time for the ACA.  Often being told you have too much study for exams the manager thinks are easy (in many instances the manager has completed a different qualification, not the ACA, so do not know what the exams entail).  \r\n3. No work/life balance - most weeks from September to April/May have been 60 hours at least, mainly due to a lack of headcount in the department.\r\n4.

    "In our Roanoke office, there have been two rounds of cuts, the second round just happened, which directly affected me. My internal evaluations were significantly better than others that I've started with in the same position, but those people are still there. Although this is a small firm, you definitely feel the sense of politics in play. They don't care about how well you work, only how much upper management in the company like you. This is obviously something common in the consulting industry, but the fact that people get laid off without reason, even though they are hard working individuals disappoints me. Afterward, I hear that people weren't laid off due to performance, but because we just weren't needed anymore due to the types of services the firm was trying to sell.\r\n\r\nI was extremely loyal to the firm, and did not attempt to get other jobs even though head hunters were contacting me every other week -- this got me nowhere, and now I am stuck without a job in economic turmoil. We had no idea we were getting laid off, it just happened out of nowhere.\r\n\r\nIf you're good with office politics, this may be a great place for you, but otherwise I'd stray away, as the firm will get rid of you once they've milked you for all you're worth.",

The partners will tell you that you are great until they are done using you. 80% of the partners at RSM are dead weight who are partners because their firm was bought by RSM years ago.

Long hours culture, and then they resent it when you try to claim the overtime that you are due. \r\n\r\n5. A lot of pressure to meet targets. \r\n\r\n6.

    "Where to begin:\r\n-The pay is below average. You work long hour days and the amount for which you are getting paid is less than someone working as a Dental Assistant for $15 an hour. That is when you think about the amount per hours you put in slaving.\r\n-The office politics...atrocious. Managers/Sr. Managers/Partners have favorites. That is a blessing and a curse. A blessing, because these people will speak highly of you. A curse, because now, you're the go to for everything, causing you to be over-worked and stressed out. Meanwhile, the average good performer to low performers have less work to do, and the balance is completely off.\r\n-This company lays off people at will; yet they cannot explain how they determined which individuals to get rid of. They will do this towards the end of busy season, right after you spent the last 3.5 months trying to make them happy and get the tax and audit work done.\r\n-There is no work-life balance, especially for people with families. The job comes first before your family and that is a sacrifice you are supposed to make. \r\n-They talk about the flexibility of being able to not just work in the office; however, if you work from home, they still judge you, regardless if you are actually completing your work. \r\n-It is supposed to be a team environment, but there are several instances where people get thrown under the bus...in most cases when it is not their fault.\r\n-There should be a standard procedure for each engagement...but there seems to be managers who like to have their own preferences; therefore, expect to do your work in 10 different ways to please all of these people. \r\n-One of the pros was that they pay for your CPA exam. Well, good luck studying for it while working here. \r\n-There is zero upper management transparency. You tell them issues with the firm and they do not respond with an effective solution. \r\n-HR here is a joke. The professionalism and the protocols in which they do things needs to be reevaluated ASAP.\r\n-This new \"rebranding\"...it's kind of failing. No one really recognizes the name RSM as much as they recognized McGladrey.",

The hardworking continue to be overworked/over utilized while slackers get by and still do well. Many people forced to mentor who have no interest, who consequently end up doing the bare minimum. Minneapolis office has more politics to maneuver then most Big 4 offices (and many of the RSM's offices across the country.) Staff are very aware of political issues and end up leaving around supervisor/manager due to continued frustrations. There are many great people here but the few bad apples can do significant damage to culture.",

    "The management is phenomenal. Each manager takes the time to have an individual meeting with everyone of their employees to see where improvement can be made and how it's going for them. Very understanding of any issues you may be faced with along the way. Fantastic and quick career progression and a job that pays for your efforts.",
    "Free petrol with car. That's all.",
    "Training is superb and you are able to earn great money if you are half decent.  Progression within the company is great.",
    "- Great on going training!",
    "The friends you make and the games they run",
    "Best training program, so much to learn . Great opportunities for self development and promotion opportunities. \nLovely people  surrounding me and amazing team work. \nWork with all enthusiasm and energetic people.  Beautiful and very comfortable work environment. Non stop learning new skill .",
    "None, they don't even deserve that one star",
    "Busy, lots to do, good social life",
    "Money and long term work ethic it ingrains",
    "nice place to work here"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "The hours ..but if you want to be the best you have to put them in. Anyone who works a 9-5 job will always be in a 9-5 job!",
    "The extremely long working hours, you will have no life and you will lose all your friends, the training in head office is extremely boring and long. I worked with a bunch of really mean people in my office who bullied me and everyone on head office wanted me to quit because I fell sick which was just mean, they give you a company car yet the smallest scratch had left me in over £1,000 worth of debt because fleet have to get it repaired, biggest mistake of my life was working for this company. It will become your life. 8-8 6 days a week. Don't even bother applying if you want to have a life. They claim to have good career opportunities but when I said I wasn't coping well with the hours they said there's no place for me in the company.",
    "Working on the weekends\r\nCan be very cutthroat",
    "- No work life balance\r\n- No employee welfare\r\n- Long hours\r\n- Favoritism from Management\r\n- Rules of sales changed in accordance to each consultant (again favoritism)\r\n- First company where they demoted all team leaders back to consultants and reduced salary\r\n- Impossible for new people to succeed as senior people have most of portfolios of clients making it impossible to have access to this\r\n- Too much weekend work which in this modern day is not needed\r\n- Working over 60 hours a week which is criminal\r\n- Divisional Management/Team Leaders shy away from resolving issues with front office team or any conflict in the team - they need a backbone \r\n- Flawed commission structure - again criminal\r\n- Do not get paid/rewarded for the amount of hard work you are putting in\r\n- No progression as a Move Consultant - only aspect that changes in role is the title of the position - there is NO monetary increases with being promoted\r\n- Only reward you get when you perform is a snack e.g. bar chocolate (we arent 10 years old and it is unhealthy)\r\n- Focused on SELL SELL SELL MONEY MONEY  MONEY and zero focus on welfare of employees e.g. health, tiredness, careers, stress etc \r\n- Only company I worked for where there is no employee satisfaction review/meetings",
    "Can be stressful like any job and the hours are long.  However, you get used to it and the days seem to fly by when you are busy",
    "Don't like working on the weekend.  Although need to work hard even on the weekend but I still enjoy my job and talking to my lovely colleague that makes you feel better and alive again.",
    "I quit Foxtons 1 month ago and I will never regret it. I feel like I was lured in by the promise of big bucks and free things, however I ended up spending more money than I was earning. Not only are the work days incredibly unsociable, but the competitive spirit is very hostile and some people even hide keys from you! Oh and to top it off, when you leave they hold £600 from your last wages which you don't get back for about 2 months and you probably won't get the whole amount back as they will find something to charge you for! All they care about is the money and not the person, will definitely never recommend.",
    "A lot of work, will often have to stay behind",
    "Work life balance is poor. HR is only proactive if they are unable to keep things quiet across the company.",
    "better training for employees need to do"

    "Graduate management programme quite well structured and developed over the years - still people with the company who joined the programme 10+ years previously - excellent programme for exposing you to the larger and more important functions of a business.  \r\n\r\nPlenty of emphasis placed on the cohort of management graduates allowing for plenty of exposure to the senior people of the business.\r\n\r\nPlenty of different work that the company has won/acquired and if you're forward thinking grants plenty of opportunity to move around and experience different types of infrastructure servicing, operations, consulting etc. \r\n\r\nGenerally the people are hard-working and seem to have a lot of passion & time for the company and the senior management, nice to know the upper part of the business tends to have the welfare and development of their employees on their agenda. \r\n\r\nHR continuously rated as one of the best in the business and it shows - spend a lot of time and money on training and development in the grad scheme, always open to suggestions as to what we feel could help us, including using previous years experiences to aid our future development.\r\n\r\nWork and environment so far has certainly been challenging but enjoyable. Can clearly see that I have much more to learn and plenty is being done to help facilitate this, with of course the guidance of your own initiative and those of you peers/line-managers. \r\n\r\nVaried amounts of travelling dependant on if you look for it or not/take the opportunities presented... It's a good opportunity to experience different parts of the country, cultures, work environments, economies etc. Helps to build a good picture of the company as a whole as opposed to being solely focused in a bigger metropolitan area for example London/Birmingham. \r\n\r\nAs a management graduate, you can be reasonably flexible with your working days/how you proceed with your work. In some parts of the business the strict 9-5 is required due to the nature of the work and in others can be much more flexible and reliant on you and your ability.",
    "Good team and management within company",
    "Very professional people to work with",
    "Best place I’ve worked. Continue to learn everyday. More experienced are always willing to help, if you ask of course.",
    "Their is no Pros working for Amey",

    "Usual employee benefits, able to buy holidays etc"

  "cons": [
    "Salaries are poor compared to competitors",
    "Not great pay or progression",
    "Very corporate, focus on results and numbers.",
    "Long working hours. But this is balanced out by flexible working.",
    "Can be long working hours and difficult environments as a lot of new employees transfer over from other companies (sometimes unwillingly) but it's a great learning opportunity. \r\n\r\nTravelling can sometimes be extensive/not fit well with your current work schedule but may have to be done regardless.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for a big shiny office, this may not be the place. A lot of worksites are on depots meaning infrastructure can sometimes lack! \r\n\r\nIntegration is a large part of what Amey has to deal with, there must be better practices in some situations for helping to better facilitate it.",
    "-  Office culture needs improving. Lack of a strong community and funding in social areas.\n- Average pay",
    "Amey are let down by their Middle Management,"

Their focus is on stats only and pushing people past their limits emotionally and mentally.   A bullying attitude from management is at best ignored by HR and higher ups.  \r\n\r\nPart of the issue is that they have grown so quickly, but still have a smaller business attitude.",

    "DB Risk Centre is sold as a unique division of DB with great talents. However the level of workers is very uneven and it is not uncommon to see managers with no experience at all either managing or in banking. Turnover is incredibly high, around 1 year, which means: you go, realise it is not for you within one month and start looking somewhere else.\r\nMany people from Italy, Spain, Greece think they are offered a good salary compared to their countries, but the truth is that it is dramatically below the average for Germany. There were legal actions against DB Risk Centre for contracting people with salaries below legal minima.\r\nIt is a compromise between Frankfurt and Mumbai: donkey work slightly cheaper than in the headquarter.",

    "Not always work-life balanced; worked till midnights; very dominant German culture, not that international",
    "I can't speak of any FO jobs, but from what I've observed in MO/BO arena, it's chaotic, to put it mildly. The company is trying to reform their IT infrastructure, but as an industry leading \"abuser\" of outsourcing, it's once again outsourcing away its IT problems by creating IT centers in places where it is not known for IT. \r\nIT is just an epitome of where DB's BO/MO currently stands at. Every function is intertwined with outsourcing and core locations, and there is no accountability for quality and consistency in the process. Instead of trying to gain efficiency from where the work really happens, DB just allocates work to places where it shouldn't mainly for cost reasons. This makes the structure more complicated and more bloated, and therefore, more costly. Also, even those functions that are seen as \"grunt works\" have their value, and by outsourcing away those functions, it loses a positive feedback loop. For example, juniors in NY or elsewhere won't be equipped with necessary skills or knowledge to perform their jobs as they should. In essence, too much compartmentalization and slicing and dicing of functions are becoming a new religion managers are worshiping these days at the bank. This will make them look busy and have achieved something, and thereby even enabling them to become MDs, but this doesn't benefit anybody in the end. \r\nThere are also so many middle managers (i.e., AVP to directors) in the process who just sit idly by the problems until they are forced to fix the problems. There are many good guys, but there are contemptible managers who just want to keep their jobs. \r\nFinally, just to offer my 2 cents on their geographic focus, I think the bank's direction is dead wrong. The bank's \"firm\" commitment in certain European regions is just digging a deeper hole to its problem. What they have contemplated under the 2020 strategy is essentially shedding growth regions and sticking to regions where the situation will only get worse.",

As one of the leading art auction houses, we are able to see the best artwork available from very top artists.  I have also had the opportunity to work with the most talented specialists in the art-world and have secured friendships with so many kind and brilliant co-workers.",
    "You got to see amazing art!",
    "Very good experience. Honest and transparent and constant communication throughout the process",
    "Great atmosphere, very good people mostly, incredible art, premium brand. Looks good on your resume.",
    "Travel, art, people. I learned a huge amount at Christie’s both personally and professionally. It’s an incredible company. You’re expected to work hard but the access to art and the people and clients at Christie’s make it one of the best places that I’ve ever worked at.  Travelling both nationally and internationally was an experience I will never forget.\r\n\r\nIt’s a unique place to work and the location in central London is superb for access to all the other galleries and museums in Mayfair and St James’. \r\n\r\nThe company objectives are very clear and I learned so many skills that I have taken forward in my career. It's a very corporate culture, but in hindsight I learned a lot about what makes a company successful in an increasingly challenging and complex art market. I had a lot of autonomy in the role.\r\n\r\nThe company works hard to engage with staff and get employees to meet each other, such as at the 1766 monthly drinks events. The Christmas and summer parties are great fun and well organised. Staff development through apps is pretty cool and there are so many training opportunities, social events and lunchtime lectures that really do enhance the experience of working in the company. Training happens both on and offsite and managers encouraged us to do this as part of our professional development. This certainly isn’t the case in many other companies. The IT provision (iPhones, apps) is great and there is a strong company ethos that I really liked.",
    "You will be working with some of the best in the business",
    "Opportunities to learn from specialists",
    "Incredibly interesting company to work for, being surrounded by a constantly rotating selection of the world's most beautiful objects is really inspiring.",

    "Very competitive and entry level salaries are low",
    "You should pay your interns!",
    "Management is very uneven, communications poor, wages low. Lot of politics as you get close to the top of the company. Work life balance not great particularly in New York. Everyone senior person is divorced or single which should tell you all you need to know.",
    "Long hours but it was worth it.  Promotion into more senior roles can be very slow and takes many years in most cases.",
    "There are employees working extreme hours for fear of losing their jobs. Several  layoffs have occurred in the past year. Employees are often times belittled, verbally abused and threatened by managers - and are afraid to say anything. If you are looking for a high-stress job with little room for growth, this is for you.",

  "_id": "Roche",
  "pros": [
    "Great people with a sense of purpose. I've worked here for more than 20 years in different functions and countries and never once been asked to do something I thought was wrong or unfair. Ownership structure gives senior management freedom to focus on a longer strategic horizon so the direction does not change as abruptly each quarter as I've experienced and still see in other companies.",
    "big company, always busy nice coworkers",
    "Great company. Challenging and rewarding experience.",
    "- Company shows integrity and has a strong commitment to employees and the community\r\n- Good pay and outstanding benefits - it would be hard to find a company that could match or exceed what Roche offers\r\n- Employees receive frequent perks and special appreciation events\r\n- Large company, many potential career paths available\r\n- Pleasant working environment",
    "Purchased by Roche in 2014. Good people. Good benefits and vacation. Good annual bonus.",
    "Great atmosphere and challenges to grow with",
    "Salary, development, jobs within the company, benefits",
    "Work with people coming from the best educational institutions with solid research background. Company supports mid and  long term R&D. Company invests in development of employees.",
    "First and foremost because Roche is a company which invests in its employees, period.\r\nThen, because we are a big family of over 85,000 employees focusing on one thing only, make the world a better place. I have already worked in 4 countries for Roche, and everywhere the same spirit of growing together.",
    "Decent salary. Decent benefits (not good though). Nice gym. Some freedom in schedule and work life balance. Relaxed work environment.  Tuition reimbursement available."
  ],
  "cons": [
    "It's a huge global organisation so some of the internal processes are clunky. A recent internal interview process has taken more than 3 months. Decision making in general is slow and opaque.",
    "no room for growth or development",
    "Growing and new to Roche, they are still learning how to keep the small business feel and fit into the Global environment of Roche.",
    "- Reorganization happens on a seemingly annual basis - managers and directors get shuffled around to different business units, while individual contributors get laid off (although severance packages are generous)\r\n- Promotions can be difficult to obtain, at least at the individual contributor/lower management level.  At the same time, remaining in the same position for longer than a few years is a bad idea, as it can give the impression that you aren't interested in taking on new challenges and potentially target you for the next round of layoffs.  You must aggressively seek out your own career development and network with the right people within the company, in order to move ahead.\r\n- Innovation and creativity can be stifled by layers of regulatory, quality and security control",
    "Very little to say as a negative.",
    "Nothing to criticize or to comment on",
    "Too much politics, conservative, slow moving,  not transparent",
    "Work is divided across multiple levels of management. It is not clear how major business decisions are made.",
    "Constant shifting of positions to Germany.\r\nUpper management is completely out of touch\r\nEgo driven environment. \r\nLittle room for advancement",
    "Like in any matrix organization, it might be tricky sometimes so communication, communication and communication."

    "You can learn a lot in a limited amount of time, as you're usually joining a project halfway through, and you need to pick up enough on the job as possible to make yourself useful. A good skill to learn!",
    "Variety of clients, projects, teams",
    "- I had 1 great year at Accenture. Interesting and challenging projects and inspiring leaders to learn from. Over the last 2 years, the company has changed dramatically.\r\n-  The main pro was the people (senior executives to learn from and great peers to work with). However, extremely high attrition has resulted in many of them leaving the company.",
    "Great people, plenty of projects to try your luck and learn new skills in",
    "Fantastic place to start your career and learn many different skills\r\nGreat colleagues and team members to help you deliver interesting projects\r\nOne global firm made international work possible and fun",
    "Accenture has a great consulting career model, which provides ample opportunities for growth, they have some very high profile projects and clients generally engage Accenture to deliver best in-class new technologies to gain competitive advantage in the markets. There is a lot of focus within the organisation on trainings and generate next gen leaders. Great organisation for someone looking to build their career in consulting for an overall rounded growth.",
    "Good place to develop skills",
    "- Amazing learning opportunities\r\n- Good access to senior leaders\r\n- Great travel opportunity",
    "- Quick progression / meritocracy\r\n- Good comp\r\n- Other benefits satisfactory\r\n- Interesting mix of clients and work\r\n- Useful training",
    "1) Brand but clients within Capital Markets are wising up\r\n2) CEO is an exceptional speaker",
    "Got into Accenture so I can get it in my CV",
    "Great diversity and drive for perfection"

  "cons": [
    "Hours Can be long but made up with bonuses at year end",
    "Demanding culture of long hours (not always productive)\r\nVery complicated matrix structure which made decision making slow",
    "Political not meritocratic professional culture",
    "How long have I got?\r\n- Long hours - absolutely no work life balance\r\n- Projects are poorly staffed and not scoped realistically, placing a huge amount of pressure on these left to deal with the mess \r\n- Lean business model has resulted in every person being stretched to breaking point to deliver to plans and costs which are completely unrealistic\r\n- The company promotes itself as highly focussed on training and development. However, resources are so thinly stretched that you work in constant \"fire fight mode\" without any time for training or support from senior management to develop and deliver\r\n- The complete abdication of responsibility from senior executives (at least 80% of those I have worked with do not support staff or provide adequate direction), but place huge pressure on all levels below to do their jobs for them\r\n- Performance management and promotion system does not work. Like with every consultancy, playing the political game is key to success - but the ability to get promoted / pay is not commensurate with effort and ability",
    "They expect you to work ridiculously long and hard hours. Promotion all about management perception/friendship with you",
    "Work hours are very long",
    "Some projects could be stressful and high pressure, but generally the management is very understanding and supportive in stressful scenarios.",
    "On too many projects, a 60-80 hour work-week is entirely normal. This is systematic, and probably an industry-wide problem - I've seen the same happen at IBM.",
    "- Sheer size of individual contributors can be perceived as a glass ceiling",
    "- Vendor agnostic means that we do not have preferences where technology is concerned\r\n- High rates of attrition mean that SMEs and other 'good people' are easily lost to competitors\r\n- Company can feel somewhat bloated with 330K+ employees worldwide",
    "Really long hours, not good salary",
    "1) Too many Senior Managers and above who do nothing but Accenture internal work at client site.\r\n2) Long hours for zero bonus\r\n3) MD's don't care about their people - you really feel like just a number\r\n4) Industry SME's not valued - just used by seniors above when RFP's come in and they need people with the context\r\n5) Sell work that they cannot deliver and work the client doesn't need"

  "cons": [
    "Contractors are not provided with Holiday or Personal Time Off.",
    "low commision and not real creative control",
    "* Use old technology (was on Windows XP up until a year ago).\r\n* Very little career progression.\r\n* Decision makers (i.e CEO/CFO/CIO) have no contact with those on the front line.\r\n* Focus is given to the sales function. Huge divide between the way that the sales side and central functions are treated.\r\n* Rewards and incentives are all for recruitment consultants, not central functions. The only benefit available to all employees, including central function is'YouChoose' which offers products which Hays claim to be at discounted rates, however cheaper alternatives are always found. Central functions do not get entry into holiday draws etc.\r\n* Very little changes, despite asking.",
    "Pay is low, favoritism, no structure",
    "-Below market rate base salaries\r\n-Minimal meaningful benefits, even at manager/ senior manager level\r\n-Hays publish a lot of thought leadership for their clients around retaining talent with regards to salary, benefits and culture etc however they do not apply the same logic to their own workforce\r\n-Goal posts for promotion targets are inconsistent\r\n-Staff turnover high and limited ability to change the vicious circle due to lack of decision making power at a local level\r\n-Flexible working is limited\r\n-Recent changes made to flex dress code but still overly and unnecessarily corporate, often having to earn dress down days rather than being respected and trusted to dress appropriately where necessary and act accordingly. \r\n-All of this resulting in quality consultants going elsewhere in order to be rewarded more competitively and work in a modern environment\r\n-Investment in appropriate training as you develop through the business drys up\r\n-Far too much time spent on encouraging consultants to do more and more (KPI hell) rather than focusing on quality\r\n-The commission structure is not set up to support associates make a worthwhile amount of commission in their first year, particularly on a temp desk. So be prepared to live off your low base salary for some time!\r\n-Even with an influx of resignations, the root cause of the unhappy  workforce is often not addressed instead the revolving door starts again and more people are hired. In most cases the problem is the Director leading the office or the manager of the team. \r\n-Hours are long, which personally I'm not afraid of, however Directors are reluctant to get their hands dirty whilst managers are away on annual leave, meaning little rest bite. \r\n- Far too many underhand counter offers at the point of resignation",
    "- Salary too low for an internship considering the amount of hours you do in a week.",
    "provides Low Salary and benefits",
    "Ruthless, if you can't cut it you are pushed out. Relentless pressure to perform and a near unobtainable level. Epic micro managing",
    "Finding enough time to do everything that needs to be done each and every day can be sometimes very difficult however what a great position to be in.",
    "Base salary is low, although commission structure is good as it is uncapped. \r\nDespite the commission structure being uncapped, standard requirements for commission earnings have the goalposts moved far out of line with consultants of a similar level to minimise payout of commission (thoroughly disheartening!), as well as promotion targets being different for consultants of the same level just because you are successful on your desk (again, disheartening - you make more fees for the company than a similar desk in the same division, yet have to work even harder than a comparative desk to get promoted - illogical!)",
    "Old processes, and senior people who fight change",
    "Manager was a horrid person, Complete and utter bully. Place is cliquey. Work with some nasty sales people too. No support from upper managment when raising issues. Newcastle branch was an awful place to work.",
    "Long hours and sometimes can be stressful but is very rewarding.  Role isn't for everyone as is a very sales focused environment and if you don't like working to targets probably isn't for you.",
    "long hours but only if you want. if you want to outperform everyone else.",

    "Onsite roles can be a little isolating.",
    "Big push on meeting KPIs no matter what and long hours",
    "Wage levels are lowish but that's the normal that you would expect when working for agencies",
    "Hays suffers from high levels of staff turnover for two main reasons: 1) lack of personal success and fee generation, leading to lack of gross earnings or 2) high personal success and inflexible remuneration structure to fend off competitor agencies.",
    "The job is all encompassing so you may end up working long hours and a lot of effort is required....however this isn't a con if like myself you are ambitious and in a great team full of like minded people!",
    "Long hours and sometimes a work life balance is hard to find",
    "High turnover - not the most transparent company",
    "Significant pressure to get new contacts. Salary is pretty dependent on performance commission. Not really any negatives that you wouldn't expect.",
    "The compititions there were a lot, mangers will not protect you if you do anything wrong. They will not tell you what is wrong before you have done things wrongly.",
    "- You have to be super resilient, otherwise you will not fall in love with this job\r\n- Day to day decisions can take too long to be approved by senior management, and job opportunities can often be lost\r\n- Business strategies can get lost in translation\r\n- Constant target and KPI pressure is not to everyone's liking\r\n- True flexible working is not available",
    "Some bookings don't last as long as u might want them to! The system hays use to deduct stay holiday pay is awkward. Some incompetency amongst a few staff in the hays office.",
    "Not all, but some managers or supervisors can be very micromanaging .\r\nThere is organizational changes every week...from management, to structural, and more.\r\nLow base pay.",
    "Very political, Not PC and when you get to the top you are no longer supported",
    "- Salary was not the best out there",
    "longer hours than some business, but this is the nature of the game!",
    "Poor GST Management - HOD belive he is god in ODS as no upper management check on him. \r\nNo process and visibility of work\r\nEmployees are treated like slaves.\r\nDead opportunities for personal growth. \r\nVery rude behaviour of middle and top management in GST,",
    "Long hours, could be better work/life balanced",
    "Work-life balance is not great but that is recruitment for you. The stress can get to you but again, it is what you make it.",
    "It is a sales-driven environment that will demand hardwork. If you like a good challenge and want to push yourself, this place can be very rewarding.",
    "Very boiler room and kpi driven. Not a great commission structure and you are lost amongst loads of employees.",
    "Recruitment by its nature is hard work and requires resilience and determination.",
    "hard work\r\nthe values they promote are not reflected with their staff",
    "- The hours are long, however you always have stuff to do so they go quite quickly",
    "micro management  is there in hAYS",
    "Hays is stuck in the past with its pricing and customer and candidate development",
    "It's a competitive industry but if you work hard you will certainly see the rewards",
    "Experienced sexism and racism, issues raised were not dealt with effectively by senior management. Persistent micro-managing and being threatened with my job until I eventually quit. Commission structure is also terrible in comparison to other recruitment companies.",
    "Everything is fine and keep on enhancing the service.",
    "Everything! From the management that only care about KPI's to the colleagues that only care about booze and talk bad things about the others as soon as they turn their back. Horrible place to work! Really long hours and pressure to the top!",
    "Low commission % and 4 weekly pay",
    "As in all recruitment / sales roles there tends to be a work hard culture and this sometimes means long hours and pressure to deliver."

    "Honestly the worst place I have ever worked. Lack of moral. No proper training or communication. No progression. They don't seem interested in retaining talent, which means they don't invest in you or your career so all of the good people go. This is the place to go if you don't want to feel challenged and like leaving the office at 4:30. Ideal to join during middle age and stay until you retire."

This unfortunately maintains the same poor standard and people do not think, they just do.\r\n\r\nProgression - forget about it.  Speak to any former employee and they will repeat that there is a glass ceiling; Junior/Middle Management look after their own and that's it therefore sadly progression just does not happen.

    "Expect a HUGE amount of hard work constantly which is draining\r\nOut dated systems & processes that stifle competitiveness\r\nPoor change implementation",
    "-Pay is lower than competitors. They say the bonus month makes up for it but it's difficult to cope with it the other 11 months. \r\n-Pay rises are based on time you've spent there not performance. Some people are useless and are earning much more than someone there for a year working their socks off, based on the fact they've been there for 20 years.",
    "Admin-heavy role and sometimes feels like progression is slow.",
    "Could be harder on poor performance. At times the need to avoid controversy seemed to get in the way of dealing with poor Partner performance.",

    "using the \"market rate\" to set pay, really!!!\r\nBeing told what to do and not asked.\r\nDisciplinarians who thrive on putting you down \r\nCertain managers are bullies\r\nCertain managers are alphabetically challenged\r\nHaving more work put on you without consultation on any prospected pay increase.\r\nPartnership ethos has gone, it's just another company driven by profit.",
    "Slow progression but there are good opportunities if you push for them",
    "None I can think of!",
    "The  internal politics are the same as most other companies. The physical environment is poor with offices under-invested in.",

    "Limitations on progression\r\nSometimes too feels like too big a company to recognise the individual",
    "Low salary high pressure not paid overtime",
    "Bureaucratic, loves having rules for everything, sometimes slow-moving and the size means that it's becoming increasingly impersonal, with more and more centralisation of services and functions that used to be face-to-face. Retail is a tough place to be and there will be more belt-tightening and more change to come as a result. Don't expect Bonus to go back above 10% for a while.",

    "No one at that company has any interest in helping any customers",
    "As a field technician my time at Virgin went completely downhill as soon as liberty global took over. It's lost its fun values and a vast majority of techs have zero morale. Management is an absolute joke, no idea how to engage with their technicians, will never answer the phone to help and are constantly trying to build up evidence to pull you in for a disciplinary. There is no trust in techs and this is quite evident when they are watching your trackers all day. The workload is an absolute joke. Your whitespace no matter how small is always filled so there's absolutely no chance for you to recover if you have a job which takes longer than usual which happens most of the time seeing as you're only given 31 minutes to do a job where you're told you also have to try and generate 2 sales a month otherwise you can't get a good score in your 1 2 1. If you're feeling under the weather and don't feel like you can come jn to work you're bullied and intimidated to come in and complete your 16 jobs a day. You do get to voice your opinions in a survey once every year howver the managers will have a team meeting before you complete to brainwash your minds and then stand over you whilst you comolete your survey watching what youre doing. All in all virgin media has lost its values, and is no longer a company everyone would love to work for.",
    "So many cons.  Initial 2 week training away from home is pretty useless and basically covers their backs. \r\nThe team was weird with so much talking behind other people's backs, it was sickening.  Everyone is very morbid and demotivated. \r\nManagement was useless and was the least supportive, least motivating and least proactive manager I've ever worked with, and would hardly look up and say hello when you went to the office. \r\nI was in Field Sales and had to ask again and again for training.  When I went out for training, the tips are basically to mislead customers to get a sale. \r\nSales aren't easy!  Customers will take you for a ride and you will find yourself driving a long way for no reason whatsoever. \r\nI actually hated the job, it wasn't a great experience. \r\nThe product is not as good as it sounds, there are many faults and customer service issues, which you will have to deal with. \r\nThere is zero support on a day-to-day basis. \r\nI fear for anyone who starts here, please think, think and think before taking up this role.  I am embarrassed to have it on my CV. \r\n\r\nThere are many other honest jobs around other than here.  Career progression is non existent and because you will be expected to work evenings and weekends you will lose your social life.",
    "the work I was doing was outsourced due to the size of the company and cost effectiveness, this proved a difficult time which never improved the service IMHO",
    "Need to work under pressure to meet targets.\r\nOccasional friction amongst different teams working together.\r\nNarrow range of prospects for promotions.",
    "Have to wait 12 months to be eligible for a wage rise. Not much progression. Pay poor.",
    "Sometimes challenging jobs to do"

    "some facilities could be improved",
    "Poorly organised at times and little is done to address concerns until the last minute. Rota is inconsistent and seen by some as favouritism, especially when overstaffed during quiet times.",
    "Sometimes not enough hours whilst some staff get loads",
    "Chaotic management. Last minute scheduling. Unclear promotion process. Heavy bureaucracy. Increased reliance on managerial newspeak. Some students can be arrogant or unreasonably demanding. Little flexibility to organise excellent teaching that is centred on students' needs in spite of the usual rhetorics of excellence. Heavy reliance on part-time, temporary University Teachers."

Things may now have gone the other way as it appears a cull of senior managers took place during a cost-cutting phase. \n\nYou can work as hard as you like but don't expect any rewards, whilst other can do as little as they like, either being sick, going on holiday, or leaving early. Standards are low across the board so don't expect integrity and good ethics when you most expect it - from the top down.",

It's a friendly atmosphere but depends on individual partners and offices. Some are very helpful, and some have an attitude. Work is very process and detailed oriented, lot of learning.",
    "Very good people overall, atmosphere in the office is laid-back.",
    "Well-researched intellectual property. Intelligent and capable people.  Excellent opportunities to learn if one hustles (being a self-starter is essential).  Great tuition reimbursement benefit.",
    "Multiple available projects throughout the country with Futurestep.",
    "friendly and international environment, talent academy, language classes, fruits on Wednesdays, flexible working hours, possibility to work from home",
    "Being attached to the Korn Ferry brand name is good at the senior levels\r\nSplit desk model - BD done by mgmt team so recruiters can focus on one side of the equation\r\nPaid salary instead of draw/commission",

Others have zero interest and may be looking for an indentured servant.  Do you homework before joining because the partner you work with will make a world of difference in your future career and overall experience. It could be great or terrible.  There are a lot of resources in terms of research - although you must have the time to do much of your own research. The researchers are limited and have high work loads. Another pro - generous time off.",

  "cons": [
    "culture; and sincere lack of empathy or compassion for talent",
    "For an HR consulting firm the internal experience as an employee is a joke: promotion processes are purposely opaque, the bonus you get each year does not at all seem to rely on your actual performance and peer reviews. Your future at the firm does depend a lot on your manager and their willingness to do their job properly or not – if not, do not count on HR to help you on anything as at Korn Ferry you are on your own. \r\n \r\nManagement is outdated and every decision comes from the US even in markets for which local nuances would make a huge difference. CEO is out of touch with the employees, and his weekly emails repeating the same stories about his childhood and experiences are just one of the many clear signs of that. \r\nThe rest of the leadership team is either completely disconnected from the field or is just left with no decision power and is trying to act like they know what they are doing when it is clear they do not. Local management has close to 0 power in the decision-making and is left watching their employees leave one after another. \r\n \r\nI cannot recall one of my colleagues being genuinely happy at this firm: people are either fearing to be laid off or just completely disengaged. Conversations around leaving the place are common. \r\nIt seems like no one, including clients, is really believing in the strategy of the firm and/or fully understanding the position they are trying to build in the market. \r\n\r\nIronically enough the firm seems to only care about numbers as you will constantly be asked to provide explanations around billable hours etc. BUT does not seem to act on any of it later: there is absolutely no anticipation of anything around hiring, using furlough, laying off people and decisions seem to be always so short-term it is actually scary. If you are going to spend time bothering people with numbers, DO USE THEM and try to look like there is a pilot on board. \r\n\r\nThe COVID crisis has ended any kind of ethics that yet existed in the firm: the extensive use of furlough was just one example of it, massive layoffs being another. \r\nThere is a culture of fear and if you stay too long their toxic environment will end up impacting your self-confidence and will make you stick around by fear of not finding another job/not being good enough: you will also end up being paid way below market as pay increases are close to non-existent. \r\n\r\nAs a final note, the firm is developing their offer around D&I (or DE&I now) when there is absolutely no inclusion internally: the teams are NOT diverse, and the leadership team is mainly composed of white males in their late 50s. Even if they will try to showcase a different version, the truth is KF is still a very old boys’ club ruled by people with the same backgrounds, who share the same conservative ideas on how a workplace should be run. \r\n \r\nIf you are a potential candidate, I would advise you stay away from this place. The negative reviews on Glassdoor DO matter and reflect the truth. This place will use you up and make you think that you are not good enough: there are other firms out there willing to invest in your development and career – go and work there.",
    "There are no major cons that I can think of",
    "Working hours\r\nPressure to perform\r\nLittle consideration for employee's mental health or personal life\r\nIncredibly hard to progress\r\nYearly salary reviews are not conducted\r\nAmerican management style, i.e. financially driven and performance above all else",
    "Minimal progression and poor leadership",
    "Widespread lack of clarity on who does what; no organizational chart available, lack of communication from upper management.  Unclear how to get a raise/be promoted.",
    "Don't expect a longterm career. A lot of nepotism and old boys club atmosphere what could get frustrating. No clear bonussystem.",
    "No salary increases given annually.  Even with a promotion not guaranteed to get a raise. Also raised cost of healthcare plans so essentially all employees salaries decreased.",
    "mainly interacted with colleagues in other states/countries via phone, no team, work by myself majority of the time",
    "No work/ life balance, people are not recognized for their above and beyond work.",
    "trainings for employees are limited and compensation",
    "I experienced workplace discrimination, harassment, and discrimination. Since this is a company that is suppose to excel at advising other companies, it was surprising. However, the Sr. Client Partners and Execs who bring in the work are \"allowed\" this behavior and a blind eye is turned since they bring in company revenue. This sense of entitlement, power, and lack of respect for others is what ultimately is the number one con. Additional cons are that there is little room for development beyond the SA role. Most partners are not vested in your career or development beyond that point.  You will also work 60 hours a week. There is high turnover  - in part because they don't give raises and a change in bonus structure is promised every year but doesn't happen.",
    "There is no diversity amongst leads and management. Overall, this is a very racist company. Hard for minorities to move up the ladder. On an average, minorities receive lower income. Too much politics and finger pointing with every client. Disorganization and not enough raises and promotions within minorities. One thing I have noticed is that coworkers who work from home are extremely prejudice and set on their ways. We need those currently working from home to transition into the office environment which will teach them about diversity, acceptance and how to work with different personalities. Leads should not entertain or encourage coworkers who are apparently racists and bigots which is evident via email corresponding. There is no one to report these allegations to since HR and management are all friends, on the same team and play politics amongst each other.",
    "They need to invest in skill training for the employees. Also have an internal HR whom you can reach out to. Have a career path mapped out for the delivery team. Also work out the compensation which matches the competition.",
    "Noone has heard of Futurestep - constantly mistaken for Futureshop.   At the mid-level, most people haven't heard of Korn Ferry\r\nMgmt doesn't always bring recruiters to client site, so information for a search is often delivered second hand\r\nDatabase is cumbersome to use and outdated\r\nResearch support poor\r\nCompetition between Korn-Ferry and Futurestep for roles when the market started to decline.",
    "Need to market yourself inside the organization to get on projects",
    "1.  The ONE LinkedIn account was shared with 25 other recruiters who did not have direct access to the LI account.  Only 1 sourcing strategist was allowed to pull the information.\r\n2.  They failed to tell me that the project was 10 months behind schedule when I joined the team.  \r\n3.  The team was only me and 3 others were added later and dismissed within 30 days.  \r\n4.  How can you deliver 97% of the project within a remaining time frame of 17%?\r\n5.  The expectation was for you to work 60 hours per week and only be paid for 40 hours per week.  The project specs did not allow for hours beyond 40.\r\n\r\nRIDICULOUS!!!",
    "Nothing to comment about. Everything is good",
    "sometimes challenging cooperation with onsite teams"

There is no unity and it's as the saying goes \"my way or the high way\".  Staff in the IT department feeling low (not because of WFH) but because of the blame culture and approach.  There is indirect racial behaviours and only certain race people are being employed.  I would give a 0 star if I could.  If a lower member of staff doesn't agree with the ideas the senior managers are making they will make your life hell and manage you out without you even realising.   They will build a case to get rid of you.  This should not be happening.  Bully behaviour should be eradicated in this day and age.",
    "* Lack of planning, which creates confusion and frustration between departments\r\n* Lots of seniors having conflicting views - which makes planning things longer"

The new manager decided that he had no intention of keeping us and as a result we received no further training or assistance. His demands were unreasonable and unfair, expecting even experienced staff to manage workloads that they couldn't possibly do alone and then sending them for disciplinaries when they failed. \r\nI left before my temp contract was up because this manager refused to reduce my hours when I returned to college and I had to put my education and health first. \r\nI am still in contact with many of my old colleagues and staff moral is at an all time low.

  "_id": "Pearson",
  "pros": [
    "Education is an inspiring purpose.  Pearson creates products that really make a difference in education. \r\nThe people at Pearson are awesome.  They are intelligent, passionate, and professional.",
    "Good pay if you're aching for a source of income. Administrative staff is understanding, very patient, often lenient, and above all helpful. Comfortable working space in the area I worked at (Puerto Rico). Opportunity for career advancement if you keep working with them.",
    "Easy tasks, good with scheduling, every one is friendly and tries to work with your other schedules.",
    "Great sector to make a difference",
    "Good benefits and 401K including employer contribution.  However, never could understand how many people were bonused on the same sale especially the custom publishing ones.  Often resorted to gimmickry (bundling book packages with useless junk)  and mid-year price increases in order meet sales goals.  Sales staffs were often not given their annual sales goals until mid-year or later.  It was a big game with much number shuffling and smoke and mirrors.",
    "Steady hours and pay\r\nConveniently located off hwy 169\r\nPlenty of opportunity for advancement",
    "A lot of learning opportunities and you may touch every tech stack you find on earth. Company culture and benefits are so impressive.",
    "Pearson was by far the best company I'd worked for, and were it not for COVID-19 changing life circumstances, I would still be there. I thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to work on hard problems with smart colleagues all over the world. I don't know if it's just the UK-driven corporate culture and all UK companies are like this, but this experience is something I will treasure for the rest of professional career.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n-Pay and benefits were at or above market rate for IT skills in the area\r\n-Global footprint, a huge, diverse workforce and an inclusive culture\r\n-Focus on talent development and maximizing team capabilities\r\n-Collegial, collaborative atmosphere and decent managers and management\r\n-Management actively solicits new ideas and is open to engaging, and does not have an authoritarian/top-down approach to 'performance culture' that many US-headquartered companies do",
    "Pearson is generally a great company with amazing potential in the global education space. Benefits are good.",
    "Many people who work there are well intentioned, smart and care deeply about education. The company has the potential to revolutionize education.",
    "Great people to work with. Flexible",
    "Great benefits, wonderful colleagues, ample opportunities to take on more responsibilities within one's position.",
    "refactoring and trying to do the right thing",
    "The environment at Pearson is very politically correct, you work with friendly employees, Glenview has nice office grounds. Office equipment is generally up to date and IT is friendly.",
    "Colleagues are bright, can do, interesting people who band together when the going gets tough, it's the people who keep you at Pearson.\r\nThe UK business is also very focussed on helping people achieve a good work life balance, so quite a few people work part time. It's  the most understanding employer I've come across when your child is sick, or you need time to help relatives etc. Though not sure what other geographies are like.",
    "Good company to work till you retire",
    "Largest publisher with a mission to improve lives through learning.",
    "Good place to work ,good for mid level carrier.",
    "Was a great group of people to work with and for. Great benefits.",
    "Coworkers, for the most part, are friendly.",
    "Continuous Improvement is the standard.  Something is always changing.",
    "It's a face-paced environment with many extremely smart people who share a love of learning.   Outside of the staff positions, there's no such thing as a 35-hour work week and you have to accept and embrace that fact in order to succeed. More important, you have to care about education, learning, and helping others because that's the entire focus of the company. It's very competitive but it's also a meritocracy, so you can get promoted quickly if you deliver results. It's hard to identify a single culture because there are so many offices around the world. It's a particularly good fit for moms and dads with young children as the benefits and flex time are generous.",
    "Great place to work!  Great people, great mission, and great environment!",
    "Pearson respects my skills, capabilities and rewards success.  It pays well and it's location (in Central London) is fantastic.",
    "Great people to work with, depending on your team\nThe team tries to keep everyone engaged\nFlexible working hours",
    "The people there are okay. Easy to talk to/get along with. The benefits are reasonable with healthcare and eye tests included.",
    "The opportunity to provide education to students who for various reasons worked better at home, or had schedules that were suited better to working at home.  Students have to maintain a minimal pace, but can work faster if they prefer. As a special education teacher, I had a smaller caseload that general education teachers (not unusual for most school settings), and did video classes, which was fun. The opportunity to work from home is available though I was not there long enough to earn that privilege. A caring and dedicated staff.",
    "Work life balance is great. The work was interesting and exciting at times.",
    "Smart, Friendly employees great atmosphere",
    "The company has great benefits and excellent products."
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Building products with out-of-date technologies. Strict processes that seem enforced more in order to keep things for certain teams to do rather than them being particularly helpful. Problems often seen, but people seem to prefer to just work and deal with them instead of work up the chain to make improvements. Very inefficient processes. Lots of Agile talk, no Agile walk.",
    "Management is very inept and incompetent at all levels. No career progression, job roles arfe very dull and limited.\r\n\r\nThe management are pen pushers who work to statistics and  numbers without considering anything else. As long as all their figures are in place then nothing else matters. Most of the team leaders cannot lead seeing as they don't know anything about the job that the team is doing (especially the technical roles). \r\n\r\nI think this is common with a lot of offices in the UK - management are piss poor at best.",
    "Upper management really does not have an idea on what is going on. Way too many layoffs.  A lot of duties have been moved off shore.",
    "Nothing cons about this company",
    "But, In order to work till retirement, You need to be like a Tanjore doll on whatever the higher up says.....even if it is wrong against policy of the company.",
    "have to change passwords every 4 weeks, can be slow, not a lot of employees to switch shifts.",
    "-Levels of bureaucracy and large organization mean decisions take a while to make\r\n-Company will make investments in things without fully thinking through, only to discard later, when more thorough analysis could have saved time, money, and frustration",
    "There is a serious lack of leadership.  The CEO communicates the companies vision, but many of the other levels of leadership rarely communicate to their organizations.  There is a lot of ambiguity and lack of clarity across the organization.",
    "Requires a good deal of motivation and patience when things get repetitive. Exceedingly repetitive job, easy to get frustrated and tired. Inconsistent employment; seasonal.",
    "Higher ed division mismanaged and only got worse in recent years.  Company is trying to transition from print to digital but has no  real idea how to achieve this.  Uses terms like efficacy but no one really knows what that is supposed to mean much less explain it to the customer.  Often announced poorly timed, Ill thought or impractical initiatives and programs that never really got off the ground. They were often quietly scrapped and employees were strongly advised not to bring them up in even casual conversation.\r\n\r\nHas been reorganizing for the past few years and no one really knows where this is headed (including many senior managers). Many, many employees are just keeping their heads down to not get noticed during the reorganization.",
    "Expected to know new processes after being taught it once, even though you may not have to use the knowledge for 6 to 18 months.  Frustrating.",
    "I can't speak for the whole company since it is global and it matters tremendously what business unit you are in. I used to love working here but my experience has gone downhill the past year with the restructuring. The bureaucracy has increased (including a travel policy with no airline preferences, you can't pay for assigned seats on cheap airlines so you scramble at the last minute, and taking late night or connecting flights to save $50). People in my area are leaving like rats from a sinking ship, and it feels like nobody in management cares. I assume things will stabilize over the next two years after the restructuring, but for now it's a tense and frustrating place to work.",
    "The culture is terrible. Many people just putting their time in and defending turf. No corporate vision. Many layoffs. Can't deliver quality product - terrible technology.",
    "Long hours, and spending weekends and family time working.",
    "Accelerating digital delivery not always educationally focuses",
    "I was field based, and in my region, the atmosphere was very negative, especially when working with other groups within Pearson. It was easy to put in 60 hours a week and it was expected that you would respond to all e-mails within 24 hours -- even on the weekends. To be considered for management, you had to be in with the \"right folks\" or your opportunities were nil.",
    "Compensation could stand to be right-sized.",
    "management changes made it hard to see a clear purpose and direction.",
    "As a special education teacher, HUGE amounts of time spent writing IEPS, holding phone conferences for both qualification and for IEPs. A supervisor who was tryiing to improve the quality of special education services, but as a result was overly demanding about quality of IEPs, making job very difficult. Difficult to look at a computer all day, rather than interacting face to face with students. Pay was minimal and below the standard for an experience, highly educated teacher.",
    "Work Life Balance - as an hourly employee, it was impossible to complete all of my assigned take in eight hours\nSalary - For my hourly rate and experience, I knew I should have been making at least $3 an hour more\nUncertainty - With the previous reorganizations, there was speculation of job security",
    "It's a confused place - still years of mismanagement to work through.",
    "There are a lot of initiatives happening all at once, so it's sometimes hard to keep everyone focussed on delivering projects.",
    "Have gone through several reorganizations in the past several years and this has impacted morale to some extent.",
    "For three years management kept us in the dark about dosing the warehouse. They just started outsourcing to other companies, customers are left behind with no knowledge of products or divisions.",
    "Contract positions have a two year maximum; Pearson is outsourcing more and more.",
    "For a company this large, which you might think fights inertia, there sure are a lot of changes! It seems like some kind of re-org happens every couple of years. It's exciting but sometimes frustrating to get really good at something and then have to re-learn systems and processes.",
    "Company going through changes many cuts down the road",
    "Large company can micromanage\r\nMakes you feel like a number instead of an employee\r\nFavoritism (I'm newer than my coworker, rules apply to me and my schedule that don't apply to her's)",
    "This is not a software engineering company, technology is just an arm of it. You may find it's bureaucratic and which makes too slow for technical matters.",
    "Senior Leadership is a joke and HR could care less about the employees or their treatment.  My manager busts her butt, cares about her employees and they are trying to run her out.  Goals are not obtainable making promotions next to impossible.  The culture the last few months has been terrible."

    "Incentives, bonuses in April, flexible working hours",
    "Progressions opportunities.\nHome working is available.",
    "Genuinely colleague focussed, and although it is contact centre, it's far more flexible than most. Soon full-time shifts will only cover Mon - Fri, so no more weekends working - they're really trying to make it a truly great place to work!",
    "Excellent management, training and development. The benefits and rewards the company offers you are brilliant, you're given development reviews monthly and annually to discover how you can progress, the support is second-to-none and this company is great for your career. Everyone is really kind and nice. There is a canteen and the food is reasonably priced and there's lots on offer, a number of places to sit and eat on your lunch too.",

    "Managers have to keep up more with the growing demand",
    "A tendency to push very hard on staff to get the desired results.  Career progression limited in some departments, very reliant on professional qualifications in some areas but not in others.  Bonus scheme fairly poor for lower level staff and was subject to adverse change at short notice during 2015 which makes it feel like savings are being made at the expense of lower level staff.",

    "I have been working for Booking.com for just under a year. I have seen a lot that goes on here, and I am going to tell you everything you need to know about it. \r\n \r\nBooking.com has been at this location for about 15 months now. They are growing at an incredible speed, and there is a lot of change going on. This can be good and bad. Growing fast means a lot of hiring for every position in the office. You hear other companies say that they “hire/promote from within” and then nothing ever happens.. That is the complete opposite about this company. I have seen people start as Customer Service Representatives and then become seniors, quality associates, recruiting assistants, trainers, team leads, and even Operations managers. True Story. If you are motivated, a team player, energetic, adaptable, and put a smile on your face while providing customer service the best you can.. You will be promoted, and that’s not just for the Seattle/Bellevue office. You can transfer to any location you can imagine… Again.. True story. And remember Booking.com is an international company, with offices all around the world.  \r\n \r\nBooking.Change- Change can be hard for some people. Some people need those concrete instructions, and it’s hard for them to adapt when something fluctuates. This is a newer company in the Greater Seattle Area and they are still trying to work out a couple kinks. They are hiring a lot of new people who might be trying to figure out the best way to manage their employees.  The training has changed a lot since they opened. The interview process has changed a couple times. They have switched from one Customer Service program to another just a couple months ago. They are still trying to figure out the correct/fair way to distribute different shifts throughout the day. \r\n \r\nHaving said all that. All this change is a good thing too. You can sincerely tell that this company cares about their employees. Booking provides these huge Starbucks machines that make you anything you want. Anything. Free fresh fruit delivered every morning. An Xbox one with comfy lounge chairs everywhere, can you say FIFA tournament? A ping pong table. Even a Shuffleboard table. This office is gorgeous. Bright, open, and also has one of the best views of Seattle I’ve seen.. From Bellevue. Tuition reimbursement, Travel reimbursement, ORCA Cards, Free Parking. New Monitors, headsets, Ergonomic Office desks, and Chairs. Company sporting events, company sport teams, hiking clubs, and board game clubs. What else can you ask for? I know what you are thinking.. “Great we are just sitting down all day and can’t get any exercise?” Would a onsite gym be what you are looking for? Because they have that too. But wait- What about benefits…? They give us great benefits, and 401K. Booking.com does this because they know people with a lot to offer want to work for companies that have empathy, enthusiasm, and have a progressive culture. \r\n\r\nI should probably also mention that employees are often hired in as a Contingent staff members. I know this can be hard for some people because you don’t know what can happen.. You might need to quit your other job to take this one.. What happens if you don’t get transitioned into a Booking.com employee? Is that possible? Of course it is.. But I know that Booking.com truly has full intentions to hire everyone that goes through training. It’s just up to you when you start. Be on time, willing to learn, stay positive, and provide that outstanding Customer Service, and you could transition from a Contingent staff member to a Booking.com employee in less than 3 months.  This means that in those first couple months, you are building up towards being a Booking.com employee and receiving the full benefits package. \r\n\r\nScheduling. Dun. Dun. Dun!!! Scheduling can be difficult. But so can we. You might have a harder schedule for a couple months, but you will get an opportunity to bid to change it. The scheduling team seems to be very accommodating for bus schedules after training, and approve most vacations I have seen. The office is open from 6:00AM-11:30PM Monday-Sunday so you won’t ever work overnight.. But when it comes down to it; this is a job. A good job. If you want to get involved in a good company, and grow just as fast as the office does.. I think you can stick it out.  Typically, when a person first joins us, they are asked to work the 2nd shift and to work weekends at times.\r\n \r\nTraining is a blast. You are bombarded with culture. Around 25 new hires are in a classroom setting and you will be trained on most if not all of the questions and calls you will receive. The trainers are amazing. Very outgoing, very positive, and extremely helpful. This company invests in their employees, and it all starts with how you are trained. You will be nervous the first day, but who isn’t. By graduation, you will be hanging out outside of work with the same people you didn’t know 5 weeks earlier. \r\n \r\nManagement is very supportive, devoted, and dependent on your success.. They all have different styles of management, but from my perspective they all work. All of the Team Leads are friendly, and actually care about their teams. The operation managers, HR, and higher ups are always thinking of new ways to show their appreciation to the office, and the success the office has had. They all walk the floors and you wouldn’t be able to tell who is who unless you asked. They even could just sit next to you for the day and work there… Pretty cool. \r\n \r\nHope this answers any of the questions, or concerns you might have.",
    "Company, overall is great! Amazing coworkers and values of the company.",
    "-Located in Amsterdam\r\n-Okaish salary and lunches",

    "More than a year ago, before joining booking I read the comments on glassdoor and had a second thought before making my decision. However, what I saw after I joined was very different from what some have mentioned here. Really happy about the decision I made. What I have seen at Booking.com in the past 1 year are happy employees and great atmosphere. \r\nPros:\r\n1. Booking.com Culture\r\n2. One of the best paying companies in the Netherlands and the whole Europe\r\n3. Does not care where you come from, recruiting irrespective of your country origin. Very diverse.\r\n4. Managers are easy to talk with"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "very high artrition rate. recruitment does not end at offer, your probation is when they decide whether you fit the role. out of the 14 people that joined on the same day as I did, 4 were let go on the last day of training. that's 28% that does not make it. Would you resign from your current job for a 78% chance of being employed after a month?",
    "Work is not fun in a call center.",
    "if you are less open and quiet and cannot adapt into the working culture then you might find it hard to fit in.",
    "Global Direction by management not clear",
    "Booking is not a technology company, which means we are not playing with new shiny things unless we really need to.",
    "The pay is not as competitive as HR thinks it is.\r\nIt's been rare that I met anyone who's been working with booking for over 5 years.",
    "You have to work some weekends.",
    "There is not much opportunity for growth.",
    "Can have more investment on research and innovation",
    "very busy business especially in summer where customer need to wait up 30 minutes to be answered.",
    "The company need to look at and help employees to progress their career.",
    "Payscale is lower than industry avg",

    "No autonomy for agents, managers control even the time on loos,\r\nmost managers know less than agents.\r\nAll agents do 2 languages and they have the same very normal salary and bad shifts.\r\nManagers like to say they are approachable but when people say what they think, they have an X on them forever until they day they leave",

    "not alot, perhaps too many employees think its a holiday camp",
    "Be ready to work, contribute, be proactive and serve our customers if you want to be successful here.  We lay it out on the table, the expectations and the balance between employee satisfaction and serving our customers.  If you are not ready to give and receive feedback, this is probably not the right environment for you.  We are all part of the team and contribute equally to our amazing success and growth.",
    "no pay rise after the first year\r\nmanagement needs improvement\r\nunfair treatment regarding internal promotions",
    "difficult to get promoted, don't give enough opportunities",
    "It's customer service, so you spend all day answering calls and sometimes dealing with upset customers in bad situations. You basically are a middle man and don't have a lot of power, which can be frustrating. There are a lot of metrics and sometimes you don't have control over them, and of course those metrics affect your bonuses and potential raises. \r\n\r\nAlso it's a call center, so you and your time are always being tracked. \r\n\r\nI would say there is very little chance for advancement and promotions, which is hard if you like to move up.",
    "If you react badly to change then this is not for you. The company is constantly on the move.",
    "Poor management and a petty HR department make it very difficult to feel comfortable.  Very stressful and a lot of office politics.  Pay not worth it.",
    "No cons to be considered",
    "The management is worst I've seen. They don't work just watch people.\r\nNo benefits at work. They provide only hustle and chaos. \r\n\r\nThe senior management is lying about salaries increase and not doing anything for years. Only Dutch in the senior management, not equal opportunities.\r\n\r\nLowest salaries, no raise.\r\n\r\nYou would never ever get benefits at work.\r\n\r\nIf you ask managers for something they even don't listen. Management evaluates themselves with the highest rankings, doing favoritism.",
    "salary could be a bit better",
    "Micromanagement and no room for growth. Treated like a robot.",
    "- strict schedule you need to follow",
    "Very stressful and after a long time you may get sick of it. Customers complaining all day long about a problem that it’s not yours. All types of rude people on the phone. \nStrong pressure to keep within the targets.\nNo opportunity to grow, even being top performer.\nMost of the time you stay on “ready” which is phone (all day). \nSaw many people leaving and getting (really) sick because of the stress.",
    "Salary is not according to the level of company",
    "- Medium and high management positions are  given to English people in a huge percentage. The favouritism there is so obvious that is extremely upsetting and frustrating.  Specially because the international staff are highly qualified (and of course, all of them are bilingual, whilst the English colleagues aren't) and some of them went from high school to Booking. This creates a negative and irritating experience for the foreigners. Talent,  diplomas, international experience, etc are all wasted because you don't have the right nationality. At some point, we did even had a regional manager visiting the office to see why this was happening, and after this visit \"what a coincidence\", foreign colleagues were promoted.\r\n- Bullying, harassment, xenophobia, degrading people in monthly meetings, etc unfortunately happens but management bury their heads in the sand and they never see anything.  This applies of course only of the wrongdoer is English or friends with the management. None can touch you then. \r\n- Another big issue is micromanagement. If they ever want you out, they will start a proper witch hunt and you'll be gone. Fact. \r\n- Hypocritical HR department who claims they are there to help, but it's quite the opposite. If you get too \"problematic\" with your requests or get sick quite often, then they'll try to get rid of you, one way or another. They will take advantage of the fact foreign people don't necessarily know all their rights in the workplace. One HR associates has confessed in her previous job the role was about retention, whereas in this company it is actually how to get rid of unwanted people. \r\n- Targets are unrealistic, putting employees under unbearable stress that brings about illnesses of all sorts. \r\n- There's a maximum amount of time that you are given for toilet breaks. There will be questions asked if you go over this amount. \r\n- You can get sacked for being late a couple of minutes, but they still employ a team leader that touched inappropriately a female colleague at a work do.

However, the bad feelings are still so strong that I know I will be writing a very negative review of this company!  Mainly, because NOTHING has changed!

(NOT!)- Oh what's that another trip to Amsterdam where all the employees get deathly ill, sure that will make up for everything....\r\n\r\nThis company also loves to create new roles, which sounds great until they decide that they no longer need that position and just get rid of it!  Oh yeah, that happened!  Twice in about a 2 year span.  At least when your position no longer exists you get out, but let's say that you are foolish enough to try to stay at this company.  Of course, you can apply to a new position, but then you better not expect to make the same amount of money...oh yeah remember when I said that you barely make any money to begin with, well Booking would prefer to lessen your income by at least $10K!  \r\n\r\nIf this is not enough information to make you start considering other avenues to start a career, then take a look at the other 90 reviews on here that are all basically saying the same stuff.",

The job as customer service executive is horrible, customers shout at you all the times and sometimes they are upset because emails remain unread for even 7 days, since the company is disorganised and always short of staff. People quit all the time because of the bad management and they are always desperate to hire new people, especially at night shift.

Booking would rather promote someone based on manager review than their actual numbers! Another con is that it's hard to get fired. It's a pro in some ways but bad at times because there are managers and employees that should be fired.",
    "If this new minimum wage proposal passes, high school dropouts will be making only a little less than college-educated employees with college loans to play back. Promotions or a future? No, that's only for Europeans and the managers' friends. As far as senior management goes, cardboard cutouts motivate more productivity. Their seniors are more geared at maintaining the sheep than the workload. This is why good workers tend to be overworked because they end up overcompensating for those no longer applied.

If you have greater issues (e.g. Maternity leave, mistakes in your pay slip) you are basically left alone or told that 'it can wait' or 'it is not important'. The three  Customer Service Managers who run the Barcelona office are frankly incompetent, making difficult to understand what qualities you (don't) need to possess to advance in your career within the company. This also applies to some team leaders who are well known to have the position just because they were friends with other TLs. Every month they make every employee fill in a sheet of examples of how they made their best to bring the company values in their daily work. Given the fact that the management  is constantly mocking these values it is difficult for an employee,who is required to show a virtuous attitude at all times,  to ignore the hypocrisy of all this.

It all boils down to people management and if the people aren't being managed properly then that's going to be a problem.",
    "1. There is a bad culture within the company, when it comes to favouritism. People who just work a few months within the company and have almost no people skills, are being promoted to different roles as they are friends (with benefits) or having a relationship with other managers. As example, Person A works 4,5 years at the company and is applying for a the role of her manager, who is leaving, and at a previous job was (s)he also a manager. Person B just works 5 months within the company and this is his/her first job, but (s)he is also friends with the recruiter and has a relations ship with another manager. Person B get the job and person A get told by the recruiter \"The other people had more experience for this role and with the company\".\r\n2. You are being given targets what are impossible to reach if you work by the rules set by management, but if you got a (senior) manager who is willing to help you (see also point 1), then it is possible to get the targets, even if this means they will break laws (like the GDPR). When you will not reach our target you will have to explain why etc, but when you challenge the targets set will you get a standard response with \"But the were able to reach the target\", and when you advise why that was is it always \"Well we are not going to speak about how they reached their targets and if it was done correctly\".\r\n3. FCA and Customer Privacy laws are broken on an daily base, and when you report it to the correct department, nothing will be done. People who kept credit card details of customers are still working for the company and only received a (paid) suspension of a few weeks.\r\n4. The pay is not great at all, especially not for the stress caused by the role and the daily abuse you get.\r\n5. You will hear the Company Values on a weekly base, and as a normal employee does the company expect you to know them by heart.

    "* A very expensive place to live.  One bedroom flats are upwards of £800, and many people have to share houses and flats.\r\n* Meritocratic nature of the university is such that there aren't many opportunities to progress beyond your career level without leaving the university to get elsewhere and return.\r\n* The city becomes very crowded with tourists and language school students in the summer.",

    "There isn't a con that comes to mind"

I was expecting the drive for excellence, but I was surprised to discover just how human and humane 'Apple DNA' is in regards to accepting mistakes and human frailties.\r\n\r\nApple doesn't expect any employee to be perfect, but rather they expect employees to recognize and acknowledge opportunities to improve, and to grow from those experiences. What they do expect of you as an employee is that you show up to work alert, aware, and engaged in your mission. It's definitely not a environment where you can expect to just 'phone it in' metaphorically speaking.\r\n\r\nIn my 10+ year career at various  Apple Stores I had numerous opportunities to act as a Mentor, facilitating new employee training and onboarding. I would always tell my new employees this: You won't lose your job for making mistakes — not if you apply yourself to acknowledging the opportunity it presents, and grow from it. In fact, I witnessed countless instances that make me believe that Apple values our ability to grow from our mistakes far more than they value our infallibility. I think most of those in leadership positions at Apple believe that if you never make any mistakes then you're probably not trying hard enough.\r\n\r\nYes, you do have to consistently be at the top of your game to have a successful career at Apple, but if you show up everyday ready to do the best work of your life, it's hard not to find yourself genuinely appreciated and rewarded through your efforts.",

Since the management does not know how to work smart and efficiently, they had hard time keeping up with the industry. They always sought forcing team to work in a counter-productive way, to constantly work overtime and often doubling resources for the same work (while  still had hard time making the deadline). A good engineer would find his time was mostly wasted on fixing symptoms, doing projects that were never completed or added no value.\r\n \r\n3) Heavily politicized and lack of integrity. The management defended their incompetence by politicizing and siloing. They refused admitting poor results (let alone listening advices, learning or improving).  They promoted and rewarded their \"own guys\" who followed their agenda. They coerced (often made up) bad reviews on talent engineers who focused on results. A typical tactics is to make their unfavorables as scapegoats for their own failures.\r\n\r\nOverall it's a toxic environment, at least in the engineering portion I worked in.

    "So many but here goes-\n\n- most employees are brainwashed, to the extent that you have to question whether you are talking to a real human being with feelings and emotions or someone you know is so manipulated that you have to watch every word you say.\n\n- you have to join conference calls at 11pm, 1am, 3am, 4am, 6am.  You have to join them. They tried to curb it but nothing changed and if you don't join you'd be told off for it.  No matter the circumstances.\n\n- you are called into meetings or have to attend other people's meetings.  I calculated the hours per week in meetings and on average it worked out at around 25 hours per week.  Most of the time it's just another employee glorifying their own project which is nothing to do with you.\n\n- there is an awful culture of micro-management, everything is micro-managed.  It makes you question whether it would be quicker if the manager just did the job, but they're too busy so you're just there to handle the projects that trickle down that your manager should be doing.\n\n- the pay is competitive, but competitive just means they're paying the same as other corporates that are under paying there staff.  \n\n- there is no social life to this job.  No one goes for drinks or socialises with each other.  They're too busy or too tired from work.  It's quite depressing really.\n\n- once a week you get called into an all hands meeting where someone talks about how great we're all doing and every one stands there and claps in a righteous way, it's like North Korea.\n\n- you need to be on emails from 6am to 12am. Everyday.  If you leave work at 6pm, you better get home, have dinner and be expected to answer emails by 7pm.  You will be cautioned if you don't answer emails outside of office hours.  It still haunts me \"you never work outside of office hours\", \"well yes I do because I'm on 4 hours of conference calls between 6pm and 6am, and you don't pay for me working outside of office hours\"\n\n- if you step 3 meters away from your computer without locking it you will be cautioned.\n\n- if you go to the sound system and pick a playlist that isn't Katy Perry or the Weeknd, then someone will scuttle over and change it within 30 seconds, and I mean scuttle...like a little crab.\n\n- the meeting room booking system is convoluted.  There are about 59 meeting rooms, but you can't use them because they are restricted for more important people who don't use them.\n\n- I remember in the early days they said \"don't use linkedin or update your profile otherwise we'll know you're looking for a new job\"\n\n- everyone is busy and stressed all the time.  It's not a nice environment to be in.\n\n- the Christmas party was more like a funeral.\n\n- the churn rate is shocking, people you just start to get along with just disappear and they can't say they're leaving, so all of a sudden you're left with the old timers, again.\n\n- whenever there is a live stream from cupertino you have to stay late and watch, which would be fine if they attempted to make an effort to keep us in until 8:30pm.  But they don't, you sit there in these really uncomfortable chairs, and there's this one person who goes \"woo\" when something is announced when most of us just want to get home to our families.\n\n- everyone is so serious all the time.\n\n- HR should stand for horrendous robot.  Because that is what it is.  You log a ticket then if you're lucky you get an email from someone who didn't read your ticket and can't speak to them and it takes about 10 days for a reply every time.  Remember, you are just another cog in the machine so you don't have the right to one on one support for HR.\n\n- for a company that has the most money in the world you'd expect the best benefits in the world.  But if anything they're average at best.  When you read a review saying the benefits are good, it's because they're better than some laundrette in Kansas.\n\n- if you have a family, please don't bother. They don't care that you have anything else important in your own life but Apple.\n\n- I probably don't have to mention this but I'm putting it in for the keywords.  There is no work/life balance.

    "Management is all over the place. It started out being about the customer experience, and then it became more about the numbers and sales. If you can't get numbers in sales, don't expect to get anywhere if you're working retail, regardless of what position you want. They only care about getting people in and out with the most expensive stuff. Oh, and they definitely don't care about you or how you express yourself. Be prepared to groom yourself to the standards they expect, even though the company is so-called \"accepting of diversity.\"",
    "work time is too long",
    "Working at Apple retail is an extremely high-pressure experience. The demand for service is non-stop. Apple Stores are always busy. Customers would frequently ask me, \"When aren't you this busy?\" My standard humorous response was, \"When we're closed!\" I'd say it with a wink and a smile, but it was essentially the truth!\r\n\r\nOut of a 10+ year career at various Apple Stores, I spent about four years as a mobile-device certified technician, (a Family Room Specialist, or FRS for short). Eventually, the daily pressure of dealing with customers' issues with their Apple technology got to be too stressful for me, and I needed to take a medical leave. My store's leadership was very helpful and supportive of me throughout this period, and when I returned even allowed me to transfer to a less stressful sales position (a Specialist in Apple's terminology) without any negative consequences. I was able to speak openly with my coworkers about my anxiety attacks, and never felt unsafe doing so.",

Meaning some don’t have as enough technical expertise as I’d hoped, some lack in people skills and some you don’t see at all. \n\nIn addition, they talk very well about reaching your full potential, but with that comes a game of favouritism. If they love you, they’ll put in good word, if not, well, you may as well just remain a specialist!",

You start off thinking you're at this magical place and you feel so lucky to be working there- then after a few years you feel so depressed you start to contemplate quitting every day until you finally do it.

You will not move upward unless you are willing to put in a decade here.\r\n-Management is completely messed up. Managers move laterally to other roles and you'll get a new manager every 6 months or so.\r\n-Morale is spiraling down. On my team, the turn over of full time employees was large. A person leaving every two weeks or management finding a reason to fire employees for minor reasons when they themselves call in sick constantly. I was on a team of 20 people, within 6 months 12 were gone. A new person would be added, another person would leave. Terrible morale.\r\n-Management does whatever the heck it wants while front line people are treated like work horses. At some points,  I would see my manager maybe once or twice  a week because they are calling in sick or taking time off. \r\n-Everything is metrics based. Quality used to be the focus when Jobs was CEO but efficiency has been the focus over the last two years.\r\n-The job is soul sucking. Dread going to work everyday.\r\n-Work all holidays. For three years I missed thanksgiving and xmas with family\r\n-Getting time off is a pain. You are in competition with other team members for days off.",

Little chance of increasing salary significantly.",

Life long Apple customers are always angry because they are not used to having to hold 20-40 minutes to speak to someone about their $3000 computer.

Especially if forced to pick up the slack for others, or encountering nepotism. Noisy environment.",
    "Moving between jobs within apple can get tough.",
    "There is this overall 'secrecy' feel that is weird - and I think it permeates many many aspects of the company from engineering to marketing to sales - so you are often wondering if you are supposed to know something and not talk about it, etc. and it makes for a sometimes uncomfortable environment.  Not all mangers are great (some are egomaniacs intent on self-promotion and 'kissing up' and/or micromangers) and if one of them is your boss, bummer for you.  Work hours can be significant (its not an HP 9-5 type of place to work).",
    "Some of company values, too many different thinking people, hard to connect with many people. I guess it could be like that in many companies but it's hard to fit in if you're different from most company employees with your beliefs.",

    "Leadership structure is seriously lacking, therefore the experience in my particular store wasn't the best. There isn't one shared vision meaning the workforce can often become disillusioned and not work to full capacity.

    "I found the content interesting and engaging and the format was very much designed to ensure inclusion of all the attendees and was successful in this.\r\n\r\nAll the trainers had amazing industry experience in a variety of roles and this was obvious, their delivery was flowing and natural and albeit structured allowed for natural breaks and for any questions to be answered throughout without disrupting the schedule.",
    "Good training however it is bias towards Perm Consultants (its doesn't cover Temp tactics). The course lasts for a week for all new (at all levels) employees and they will put you up in a hotel. (Couple of months before I left they did bringing the Temp training for new recruits.)\r\n\r\nThere is a quarterly event called High Flyers were all the biggest billers of each office are taken out all expenses paid.",
    "The team on my pod are great, as are other staff within the office. They are friendly and welcoming and have helped me whilst I am still learning.\r\nThe early induction and walk around of the building has given me confidence to go where I need to without requesting help.",

  "cons": [
    "None to comment so far, little bit early into the job",
    "The management, all all levels, don't keep to their word, on many occasion they would tell me they were going to do something but would never actioned it.\r\n\r\nPoor culture; I found that most people were very insecure about their job and weren't able to have light hearted banter - it would usually turn ugly. Search seems to employ a certain kind of personality which I can only describe as 'overly self-conscious bordering on paranoia / machine'. \r\n\r\nVery KPI driven. I think they would much rather you record 50 client calls in day then make a placement. If you don't record your calls they didn't happen and if you are billing say £10K a month consistently they will still have words. They drained your business initiative by doing this as you are force to concentrate on your KPI's then actually bill.\r\n\r\nRewards & Team Culture: They only every reward you with money or sometimes a bottle of champagne. For me there was never any 'well done' or pats on the back from your team when you had broken a boundary or made a significant placement on your desk.",
    "I honestly cannot fault the training, I was pleasantly surprised at how receptive I was to it.",
    "not applicable at the moment.",
    "Paid poor, set up was very poor. Didn't know what days I would be working, I would be cancelled less than 12 hours before assessment date. The managers running the contract didn't have a clue."

    "Great people, and the company values the employees.",
    "-Great colleagues\r\n-Since the company is still 'small' you feel like you actually contribute to the companies success\r\n-A lot of exposure to other business units which can help you develop a career path\r\n-Everyone is all about 'work hard, play hard'\r\n- Many career possibilities in the long run",
    "Fantastic work-life balance\r\nSolid employee-first culture\r\n\r\nThe work-life balance & employee first culture is what makes Workday a huge differentiator in the tech space as we are an impactful organization for the customers that we serve and the employees that support everything that we do.",
    "Fantastic culture, people, energy, and full of opportunity",
    "Excellent Salary, Great Team, Good culture",
    "They really take the time to help you develop yourself and your career; emphasis on work/life balance and plenty of opportunities for fun to balance out the hard work",
    "Good Team environment and good benefits",
    "Great benefits, perks. The product is amazing",
    "Workday is a fantastic organisation, great product and great leadership.  Incredibly professional and friendly marketing team.",

    "Aneel and Dave started this with a great vision but it's reached a point where it is declining.",
    "Growing company, great market position, great products, freedom, start up culture, Silicon valley culture,",
    "Super nice people, everyone is willing to help if you need support. I've been at Workday for 5+ years and my coworkers are the reason I have stayed so long. People are really smart and friendly."

  "cons": [
    "While everyone is nice, it is really hard to grow in your career here. From what I've seen, not much internal movement and really hard to move up when people are hired from the outside.",

    "No cons I can think of offhand",
    "Some minor growing pains in finance as the company expands, but no real complaints here!",
    "Need better vetting for leadership.",
    "Not many down sides I can think of.",
    "Very steep learning curve for new employees. Must be self-motivated and search for answers",
    "- Sometimes, the overwhelming amount of meetings you're invited to",
    "As it is growing, leaders are not focused on employees or product. It's become more bureaucratic and political. It feels like everyone is in to earn a title vs product growth.",
    "Young organization, EMEA growing but not yet as developped as US",

    "Staff are trained and promoted from every level.  e.g. start as a carer and within a few years achieve promotion to regional director.   Good perks scheme and enough benefits to satisfy every employee",
    "For me the Pro's were having weekends to myself and working mon-fri, the variety of different shift hours and options to go to other departments as and when required. \r\nI enjoyed the variety of tasks required of me and to be able to learn on the job from the multi-disciplinary team. Location for me was good, a 20min drive from my home, although I didn't pay for car-parking I was able to park nearby and walk in. Uniform given and replaced when started to look worn out and using fobbing in and out system helps you to keep track of your shifts, hours and Annual Leave."

  "cons": [
    "Working in care is never well paid",
    "Intro of evening & weekend working for the role, even for those performing, not much progression, or many training opportunities unless you are clinically minded.",
    "Salary is lower than other companies.",
    "Not being paid overtime for staying late when clinics ran late but instead getting time back but often not when staff members wanted it. Often felt like I put myself out to help out and it wasn't appreciated. The only other thing I found was that as a young Nurse you lost a lot of clinical skills as pre-assessment = sitting in front of a computer for the majority of your shift unless you were in the Wound Clinic.  I found all the staff with exception of one or two where I worked friendly, helpful and for clinical staff people who actually cared about the patients and their experience.  My manager was strict but fair, and when staff treated wrongly she stood up for us."

I love walking into my clients' stores and observing my surroundings to see what test cell they are in for various initiatives they are running!\r\n\r\nBecause of APT's size, the feedback cycle is excellent. As an employee approaching my second year, I get to gather recurring feedback from managers, principals, and VPs on strengths and development opportunities.\r\n\r\nWorking hours at APT are quite flexible. Employees have tasks assigned by various teams, and it is up to the employee to choose how and when to meet those deadlines. If you like getting your day started at 7am, go for it, if you'd rather stroll in at 10am, go for it (just get your work done on time!)",

Granted, the company still operates on high margins despite the challenges, but very few people can see what's coming. For as long as the leaders are the same, nothing will change. \r\n\r\nLeadership has no people management skills, no clear objectives, very poor technical and business skills. Poor career management, very emotional and subjective decision-making, silo thinking. Highly bureaucratic and insecure. Simply no HR. Overall a very immature company who keeps on repeating mistakes: hiring old, expensive people from similar industries",
    "P&L and compensation structure not conducive to collaboration between departments or creativity.  Lack of real leadership in some of the highest positions.  People promoted based upon political positioning versus real performance. No 360 degree reviews--management not required to interview people with whom their directs are working.  Leaders not held accountable for playing favorites or not supporting their team members.",

    "Invest on more external training",
    "Under experienced and undertrained management, can make your life a misery!!!\r\nHR more interested in brushing problems under the caret than to try and sort anything out. This alone would be a reason to avoid working in this office.\r\nBig issues between the EU and US, very much a turf war. Felt like the Dublin office was the child stuck in the middle of two fighting parents.\r\nNo career opportunities, forget moving up the ladder unless you want to move out of the country",
    "Ruthless regarding layoffs like most companies",
    "Good work can easily go unnoticed unless you have the personality and opportunities to be noticed by the leadership. Connections and exposure to the right audience is important for recognition and promotions, sometimes sadly more so than being hardworking and doing a good job.",
    "- Expectation of working long hours\r\n- Lack of organisation from the top down\r\n- Open plan office, call center feel about it\r\n- Not really a technology company\r\n- Lack of visible career progression\r\n- Overloaded with processes and middle management",
    "Technology stack should be upgraded",
    "Politics and people building their own little kingdoms can slow down decision making and make everything more complex than necessary.. Lots of bureaucracy.",
    "- As with most financial IT companies the technology can be slower than other IT companies - so this is something to bear in mind, as the issuers embrace more technological advances this will become less and and less",
    "HR and career advancement is horrible",
    "office to small to grow (moving jobs internally), operationally not a great company, is moving towards the typical US shareholder value companies, very politically; proposed values seem only to be relevant for the lower levels; the company values and the reallity do not match (regionally & globally); working achievements do count less and less (only to be \"happy\" and positive seems to be the new metric); product development only on internal profitability / goal meassures - not asking \"what does the customer want?\"",
    "Nothing to add here now",
    "Restless company withfull of politics. You will only grow if you have connections.",

    "- HR too intrusive\r\n- too much Process",
    "- Putting the customer last - internal harmony more important than meeting customer needs\r\n- No concept of succession planning or people development\r\n- No growth roadmap - past growth came naturally as payments  were digitized; now VISA is eating their lunch in debit and Amex is signing up their issuers\r\n- No merchant strategy; merchants go to court and to Washington to get heard.\r\n- Employees not recognized for contributions but rather for keeping their heads down",
    "1. Senior management are not mature enough to take un-bias decision\r\n2. No on site opportunities\r\n3. Compare to other tech hub, vadodara has not attractive projects",

    "Hours. Like most consulting firms, APT is not a 9-5 job. Hours can be long at times, especially when a readout of an analysis is around the corner.\r\n\r\nSize (sometimes). Because of our size (~50 employees in San Francisco office), we still have tasks such as 'kitchen duty'. While very start-up-like, I'd prefer not to have a task on my calendar telling me it's my day to run the dishwasher this week. This may change soon as we continue to grow.",
    "The details of the job were hidden behind senior employee's egos.  I was constantly reminded that I was a contractor and not an employee.  There was an enormous lack of communication.  I was constantly being cussed at and berated.  I guess management was constantly overworked.  There was a lot of negative gossip initiated by management.  Obviously, you work hard and feel good about your work and are let down when after looking people in the eye day in and day out and dealing with a lot of nonsense you receive a call from a contract representative you've met once saying you are no longer employed.  A lot of micromanagement.",
    "There is tremendous corruption in HR. A few people have been there too long and have way too much power. Way too many layers, VPs are a dime a dozen.",
    "No such cons i could find",
    "Sometimes difficult to navigate across groups due to silos",
    "Horrible managers, bad directors etc",
    "It is difficult to get to know all the areas and working groups in mastercard as an organization.",
    "I can not honestly say there are many cons - tech issues at times but to be expected.",
    "Management didn’t have a forward thinking/innovate mindset.",
    "Budget cuts due to financial industry downturn in 2008",
    "Some of the processes around governance & control aren't the most joined up",
    "Typical issues with impersonal corporate culture, and challenges with bureaucracy",
    "Management is inadequate.  \nNo growth. \nNepotism. \nHR doesn’t care.",
    "Nothing to say as a con",
    "A few issues/bad eggs that aren't dealt with by the local HR, otherwise nothing major.  Some of the top technical people are under-appreciated, but again probably a local issue.",
    "- Slow work env. Some departments in OnT works like some under-developed country government.\r\n- Company is hugely dependent on contractors. And contractor's dont care of deliverable. They only care of 9-5 and their payment. Quality and timely deliverables are mostly headache of tech leads. \r\n- Tech leads are being treated as Punch bags. Anything goes wrong, bring in tech lead and drop everything on him/her. At least in my team.  There is no one answerable for anything other then tech leads. SSE's, SE's are just there for technical writing for the day and go home without any worries, since they do not have to answer to anyone.\r\n- Huge disconnect between decision makers and grass root level employees.\r\n- Executives makes changes every year by their own instincts.  Or some new executive joins and tries to make changes like Amazon or Apple, without understanding the dynamics of teams.  Specially in OnT. \r\n- Favoritism is important. If you are your manager's favorite and can do pep talks, you grow. \r\n\r\nAnother issue is Global mobility department. They keep you on edge all the time. Never provides timely or proper updates.  They don't like it if you follow up and expect rude responses. \r\n\r\nI am still not clear what is the role of HR in this org. They only talk to employees through managers. If you are not happy with your manager, only way is change role or job.\r\n\r\n- There is a great concept of smart move which organization promotes. But, if you apply for smart move to some other location or country, you are immediately being shot down stating no budget. Why do you promote something if you want to shut down anyways?",

Was asked if I wanted to take on volunteers that had been convicted of assaults - no training on how to handle this bearing in mind vulnerable volunteers. Was told that I should wash the donations in my own machine...no reimbursement for this. The top guys here are millionaires but do this on the back of the poor and the vulnerable. No christian values whatsoever. Money is king",
    "There is no leadership only dictators-absolutely no guidance or recognition. Under paid- no raises- no goals to aim for. There is no organization or cohesiveness within the employees/managers. The safety of the employees is jeopardized daily with no security or protocol.  If you donate money, don't! Homeless are expected to pay if they go into a Salvation Army store for clothing/shoes/hygiene products. It's a truly a shame, this organization's only value is their name.",

Besides that, local, state, and regional managers have an ancient 'but this is how we do it' outlook on all work, ignoring any improvements to efficiency or customer service.\r\n\r\nAlso, management has complete at-will employment power, so if you are terminated there is no review, no appeals, and no one who cares. A local manager was replaced in order to hide the fact that she was trying to prosecute theft from the store, and the 'pep-talk' our store heard from the state manager was that we had better keep working because all of us (~ ten employees) could be replaced over night.\r\n\r\nI was eventually fired because I was written up once for making a mistake between a light denim jacket and a heavy denim shirt... not exactly intuitive. The write-up mentioned that a second mistake would include termination. In the comments section I told the manager that in the future he should just tell me when I made a mistake in front of him, and not file paperwork behind my back. That comment led to un-reviewed early termination.\r\n\r\nAnd, despite being chronically understaffed at our location to avoid employee costs, we never made more than minimum wage, never had over time, and were not allowed to go over twenty hours a week to fill in for each other.\r\n\r\nWorst job I have ever had.",

    "Nepotism- church members who were also employees were given preferential treatment (less work responsibilities, more compensation, approved paid days off).",
    "Minimum wage for most, management is all about getting their numbers (they get bonuses) workers get the wrath of management if \"they\" don't get their bonus. Upper management is unapproachable to the point you can not speak a word to them regarding any issues. Too eager to write up workers for ANYTHING, key holders expected to do the work of management but only make a dollar more than minimum wage. You can be transferred at any time but not compensated for additional travel time. Dock workers are treated as slaves. Favoritism for those employees that kiss managements behinds, most supervisors are women so if you are a man and can flirt you will go far.",

    "Not being able to help everyone",
    "The pay was only minimum wage.  There wasn't always enough work to go around, so some days not everyone who showed up got to go out on the job.",
    "Manipulative environment , If you buddy up to manager no work expectations. Others worked three times harder. Unfair workplace. Customers dislike the public berating. Manager not pricing anything to put out and screams that clerk did not go back in sorting area and gather to price while on floor with register. Writes up to get to quit or fire. Plays favorites. Donation side  others that she befriended say she needs to fix herself.  Constantly talking about other employees giggling, then says going to church ?",

    "Managers who schedule you to work when they know you're scheduled at your other job and then write you up for not being there.  Managers who are inexperienced and don't know how to deal with people, don't know how to manage within State and Federal laws and aren't willing to listen to suggestions.  Low pay and NO raises, no unemployment if let go or laid off because they're a 501(c) organization.  Medical insurance is adequate but somewhat biased toward men--i.e. pays for cervical cancer screening once every three years but prostate screen is covered every year.  \r\n \r\nEmployees are expected to put out same number of pieces of clothing per week whether they have the stock in the store to do those numbers or not, or regardless of whether or not there is room on the racks to hang that many pieces.   Employees are written up and/or fired if it numbers aren't met and that threat is ALWAYS hanging over everyone's heads.  Very stressful work environment that really doesn't need to be.  A few small changes could relieve a lot of the stress and wouldn't be that difficult to implement if management were willing to listen.\r\n\r\nNo air conditioning in the store because Senior management says it's not needed--was 83 degrees outside today and 92 degrees inside the front part of store.  What's July/August going to be like?  No public bathrooms because Senior management says we don't need them.  Tired of cleaning urine from the sales floor--the store employees don't get paid enough to deal with potentially hazardous bodily waste.",
    "Large organization means may policies and procedures. Lack of employee evaluations",
    "Worst Job I ever had. My supervisors were imbeciles and loved throwing people under the bus for their superiors. The job was very monotonous and unrewarding. They drug tested and paid minimum wage.",
    "Amount of work is impossible.",
    "Bosses, managers and supervisors had a high turnover rate, and most had bad attitudes to employees, but, nice to customers. Bosses and employees only said happy birthday to/ introduced new hires to/ invited to unofficial office parties to the popular employees. So middle school. They also play the same 20 songs constantly. The restrooms ate grose and don't work a lot of the time. The conditions in the back room are bad. Those they want to fire or bully into quitting, they put on processing line and set nearly impossible quotas. Especially employees with insurance. Also, the prices are high. Especially the clothes.",
    "All sorts of people visit.",
    "Wishy Washy Behind the Scenes Management,Non Profit Christian My ,No Loyalty for good service,Let you hang to suffer,Rampant Favoritism from first hand observation and experience in my 10 years plus involvement with the outfit. I'm sure the Booths are rolling in there graves. The best officers get reassigned after they get things squared away and then everything gets upended with people (In My Opinion) Questionable Motives to say the least."

    "No real onboarding. No formal training. Everyone cares about utilization and getting chargeable time. Management does not delegate work well because doing so would hurt their personal utilization goals. No paid vacation time; instead they have what is called \"flexible time off\" or FTO for short. Taking FTO hurts your utilization but they will tell you that you have \"unlimited\" FTO. I have 3 different insurance providers one for general medical, one for dental, and one for vision. I spent 5+ years in school to get paid $54,500 which is peanuts in my opinion. For the past few months I have had absolutely nothing to work on. When you do have work, be prepared to travel for months on end and maybe only have 1 day or so back at your home per week. I also witnessed a PARTNER fall asleep on a client site at least twice. First day in the office and I am already getting emails telling me that I will be traveling out of state to work on a client the very next week. The culture is nonexistent and nobody cares about that stuff. I have a coach who has done nothing related to his role as a coach. If you're in an associate role nobody cares about you. They also change the structure of the firm every other year or so, so that means you never really know what is happening behind the scenes. They also change policies in order to get more work out of you. Work/Life Balance is a pipedream. But also notice that WORK comes before LIFE in that phrase. The only clients you have are the ones that the Big Four don't want for one reason or another. This firm will NEVER make the Big Four the Big Five. Also, be prepared to work with and around some VERY arrogant and snooty people.",

    "Challenging work, friendly co-workers,  great work environment.",
    "The atmosphere is awesome. Great people to work with and family oriented. Great benefits as far as health insurance, PTO, and retirement go. Many departments are good at investing in their employees and have trainings and classes you can attend. If you work on Temple Square you have a great location and awesome grounds to walk. Salary is generally below competitive for the area but decent enough to make it work so no serious complaints. It seems to be more competitive at entry level and less competitive the higher you get. Good place to start at.",

    "Sometimes the pace of the work can be slow; as in, making decisions and translating them to action can take a long time. Too many hands in the pot and everyone is afraid of conflict and saying it the way it is. That can be bad when a project is headed the wrong direction and needs a correction. When you are hired you watch these training videos about how everyone and their ideas are important and everyone can make a difference. I feel like a couple specific upper managers have been here long enough they have forgotten those videos. It is a large enterprise and there is still politics going on even here.",

    "The bureaucracy was stifling. It was often slow and cumbersome to get things done. Time logging is a pain.",

    "The incentive/bonus system is a joke. If your manager is unpopular then your bonus will be derisory.\r\nBonuses go to friends of management - no matter how inept.\r\nPromotions go to friends of management apart from on the odd occasion and the most adept employers are repeatedly ignored.\r\nWe were told that if you provide negative feedback then this decreases the likelihood of everyone receiving the bonus - so no one wanted to feedback honestly.\r\nCompendia - the main system used in the company is appalling - its failure affects your appraisal rating.\r\nManagement completely ignore criticism and aren't willing to even consider basic facts.\r\nHard work is not rewarded - it doesn't matter if you are twice as productive as the next person - you will not get a bigger bonus, but you will be given the hardest cases to work on.\r\nPermanent staff on higher salaries spent most of their time complaining, being given easy work and generally doing very little whilst contractor staff were expected to work at a much higher level of competency/given the hardest work to do but paid less.\r\nOffering to continually expand your skills base by doing additional training makes you indispensable but you still see management pets (who cant do the work that you do and are given \"baby\" work to do) given generous bonuses whilst you get no reward.\r\nIdiotic performance assessments based on meaningless / nonsensical data resulted in the worst employees being ranked higher than the people who were keeping the dept afloat.  Management not remotely interested or capable of understanding how statistics work.\r\nPay is less than equivalent employees elsewhere and the level of expertise required to do the job far outstrips the salary.\r\nRidiculous administrative processes resulting in endless duplication of effort and inefficiency (in addition to the waste of time that is compendia).  A \"pass the buck\" system in place where the failure of the system / IT is ALWAYS blamed on the pension processors who then asked to repeat work again and again - often unnecessarily.  Regarding this, management utterly clueless at best and couldn't care less at worst.  Management pets can't do complex cases so these get passed to the workhorses who then rack up \"errors\" which are used against them during appraisals.  Some cases would have 30 people working on them before they were completed despite \"take ownership\" being a core company value.\r\nCertain employees earmarked for great things despite mediocrity-  the company is so desperate for someone to sort it out that they seem to imagine that popular people (as opposed to the quite ones who are good at their jobs) will save it. - The peter principle in full effect."

I quit, but *was* offered a position in another business group. \r\n- Civil office culture - yelling & open disrespect aren't tolerated\r\n- Good coworkers - some really lovely people work there.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for a stable corporate job where you punch a clock and don't need to think independently, it's probably a good fit for you.",

There are perks galore at Capital, and the work/life balance is good. People are generally nice, especially if you land on a good team with a competent manager who goes to bat for you. Overtime is minimal and you get plenty of free catered lunches, fresh fruit left out for associates, educational opportunities and if they believe you are worthwhile they will take into the ranks, where you can remain indefinitely.",

    "Please note - this review is about American Funds Service Company - Shareholder Services (AFS) in Irvine California. Some of the review may not apply to any positions at headquarters in Los Angeles or other sites in the United States or abroad.. \r\n\r\nAwesome Co-workers\r\nGreat Retirement Benefits\r\nBeautiful Compass\r\nWonderful Reputation in Financial Services Industry\r\n\r\nWhen I started working at AFS - It was an amazing company - large corporation, but with a family feel and take care of your people attitude. While it is a large department, AFS is largely a flat organization, so the possibilities to move upward within  the department are limited - Associate, Manager, and Sr Manager. So the possibility of career development is largely only available to moving out of AFS.\r\n\r\nThat being said, the work can be challenging dealing with frustrated clients and investment advisers. The pay is quite respectable for a phone and processing center. AFS does require overtime when they are busy or understaffed. They attempt to offset this with \"voluntary\" overtime, but at times, they do require all associates to put in some required overtime. While required over time is not liked by any associate, the overtime pay helps numb that pain. The more overtime you do, the larger the contribution to your retirement plan and your bonuses. This is not always realized, but it's nice to see it when it comes in and really builds up over time. \r\n\r\nThere is a significant amount of training involved. For some the material is easy, but for others, the concepts, services, and products are really over their heads. They do a fair job of helping associates understand the concepts with additional support for a limited time (maybe 6 months or so) but after that it'll become an issue if you can't grasp the concepts or processes.\r\n\r\nThe Irvine compass is beautiful and has great cafeteria for you to purchase lunch if you want. If you commute by train, you'll develop some close friendships and bonds commuting back and forth and getting to know people outside the office. Irvine has a shuttle that picks people up at the Irvine train station and drops you off right in front of the Capital Group offices, so it's super convenient. There isn't much of interoffice socializing . A lot of people commute a long way and most days people just want to go home. Happy hours and outside social events within the department are pretty much non-existent.\r\n\r\nThe department tries to keep motivation and moral up with some on campus social events, potlucks, and providing some meals and snacks for special occasions or as reward for doing the overtime. Not everyone appreciates these things, but it could be nothing - so take those complaints in stride. It's certainly something that they don't have to do. \r\n\r\nOverall, this is a great place to start your career in financial services. The training is good and the reputation about the company will serve you well if you stay in the financial services industry. It will also be some of the greatest associates you get to work with. Lot's of great associates that you can build good working relationships with and if you're lucky, some good life long friends.",
    "The employees at the Capital Group are great to work with because they love to work here. The company also provides great benefits.",
    "You will see echoed through reviews: Great benefits, 15% contribution to 401k, etc. All true.",
    "Pays well, good retirement benefits.",
    "Capital Values are well constructed and intended\r\nAttention is paid to employees' work-life balance",
    "At the time I worked at Capital, there was a \"family business\" attitude.",

Business need has to drive how the company is managed...or the health of the entire company becomes at risk.",

    "Collaborative , considered, genuine, respectful, leadership actually role model core values, supportive environment.",
    "Incredible benefits. Great work/life balance. Supportive, engaged managers who genuinely care about your development and your success.  There is truly a huge emphasis on your development, with best-in-class resources available for associate use as well as additional leadership trainings and programs. Very flat organization; little emphasis on titles, everyone is kind and approachable.",

  "cons": [
    "The cost of the great benefits is that associates are incentivized to overlook bad behavior: eg. CMO sexual discrimination. HR & Legal are complicit, all those trillions to protect!",
    "Hard to find out what other jobs are and what they entail",
    "Middle Managers are out of touch, can't do the work, have zero empathy for the Foot Soldiers, abuse them, are at home with their families while the Foot Soldier has to work overtime and weekends to keep up.",
    "Can't think of any",
    "A lot of change at once leads to some conflicting priorities\r\nUse of offshore IT partners is strategic but perhaps needs more thought and consideration in some areas\r\nlimited advancement opportuities",
    "Minimal opportunity for internal promotion to outside sales.",
    "Can take forever to get promoted.  You could be there 20 years and still not make it to management.",
    "Sometimes restrictive environment, not a lot of career growth",
    "None that I came across.",
    "There are a lot of meetings, many of which could be streamlined or eliminated.   Little flexibility with regard to working remotely (though varies by group), though they are beginning to implement processes and moving in the right direction!",
    "Decision-making can be slow due to collaborative approach",
    "In reaction to the recession, Capital has dramatically cut costs - including many employees.  I think that the \"old guard\" at Capital valued the individual and quality of work.  The  \"new guard\"il about the bottom line and doing more with less.  The majority (if not all) co-workers that I have spoken to feel that Capital is a very different company now than it has ever been (and not in a good way).",
    "Not a lot of opportunities for growth/movement. You need to prove yourself for several years before being given opportunities for growth.",
    "If you're focused on titles and \"career advancement,\" this may not be the place for you.  Satisfaction comes from devlopment that is internally driven and externally acknowledged and rewarded with additional opportunities.",
    "Firm culture disproportionately set by Investment professionals.",
    "Extremely difficult to move up.  Management opportunities are usually pre-determined to go to a specific person, application is smoke and mirrors to create illusion of advancement.",
    "As many downsides are there are perks, sadly, but it does even out into a very neutral working experience. There is a conformity at Capital that encourages a CG style of conducting yourself. The pressure is great to conform and if you question the system you're called out for being \"difficult.\" Opinions are valued and consensus is important there, but the side effect is that you have no ownership of your work and can't make decisions independently; you have to conduct a million meetings and contact 100 people just to answer the question of how to tie your shoelaces. It can also be very Office Spacey with nonsensical TPS report-type things, endless meetings that help you Plan How to Plan and wasted time in corporate training. It's a big company and it's easy to get lost in the crowd and feel like you have nothing to contribute, often because you're not really allowed to contribute if that means rocking the boat.",
    "The organization has changed over the years and is not the same as it was years ago.  Hopefully the senior business leaders will listen to their people and work to return the environment to where it was.",
    "Directors are the weakest link in the organization, specifically in the shareholder services department.  Directors are incapable of fairly assessing performance or building high performing teams. This fact is supported by the recent low engagement scores and comments.\r\n\r\nPerformance is NOT consistently assessed or managed fairly within a site, let alone across sites.\r\n\r\nLayoffs\r\n\r\nLack of trust",
    "Lack of job security and advancement opportunity",
    "I worked in Shareholder Services as well.  Not as much work/life flexibility in that role due to time constraints of business needs.",
    "This is for our service organization specifically: Our organization really leans into a rotation/internship model professing to help build \"skills.\" However, if you consistently rely on interns to help get your work done, you should probably consider hire more full-time staff and provide more lateral moves for associates. There are multiple tiers of staff in the different service channels. However, they're not well-defined and the type of work completed everyday is fundamentally the same.",
    "Things can move slow sometimes in such a large organisation",
    "Gender gap of pay and especially promotion",
    "1 and 2 as listed in the Pros section. \r\n\r\nSenior management not sensitive to HR related issues.\r\n\r\nPromotion based on seniority rather than skill sets (i.e. a person becomes a manager despite lack of management experience). There are a lot of CG employees who have been at the company yet do not really know the business that well too. \r\n\r\nCliques involving management are aplenty; in other words, if you are a regular employee who is friends with a manager, you will get special treatment (i.e. be given more opportunities than others in order to be seen as valuable to the company and \"layoff-proof\"). If you aren't a friend with a manager, you will be harassed. In a nutshell, you need to be cordial to the clique otherwise face a bad review.\r\n\r\nNo discipline for those who do not work because of this \"everyone is nice to each other attitude\".\r\n\r\nConstantly changing processes and organizational structure. This is a result of people trying to be \"innovative\"; the normal behavior of an \"innovator\" is one who wants to accomplish things without having thoughtful analysis of the process. Oftentimes, there is no tracking of what changed or analysis before changing something; it just is changed.",
    "Brilliant co-workers have mastered passive aggression",
    "Opaque management and comp structure",
    "Incompetent/ inexperienced management, hypocritial/contradictory actions from management - do not treat associates as equals (at times condescending)...and general boredom from sitting in a cubicle all day",
    "Work from home not an option (2014), long and frequent meetings",
    "- Employee satisfaction varies dramatically depending on business group and manager.\r\n- Not a meritocracy - most places aren't entirely, of course, but it seems especially true at Capital.\r\n- Growth is often not possible because most associates are overburdened with volume of tasks.\r\n- Intelligence and honesty are not valued.  Being able to play the game is.\r\n\r\nThey promote and emphasize growth in theory, but in practice advancement is a result of politicking and interpersonal strategy. Get in good with the boss = get your workload reduced + get handed opportunities for exposure.  I saw this happen at all levels, from senior management all the way down to admin assistants.\r\n\r\nAlso - globally speaking - they're going through some big changes, so it may be a little extra bumpy for a while.",
    "Engineering culture is relatively weak. Stifling risk policies stagnate software velocity...",
    "In the proceeding years, the company was beginning to loose the \"family\" atmosphere, and became a \"big soulless\" company.",
    "Management will always say and do two different things.",
    "Within the department, the attitude has shifted from family and promoting within, to more micromanaged, cut throat, and promote from outside.  More and more, the business as a whole seems to hire from outside to fill positions in various other departments as opposed to giving associates the opportunities to prove themselves.\r\n\r\nIt can not be over emphasized that you should heed all the warnings about \"speaking your mind\", \"tell us what you're thinking\", \"share your observations\", \"we have an open door policy\", \"we are very receptive to feedback\" and any other variation of those thoughts, ideas, and concepts, because in the end, those are just key words for \"open up to us so we can make a judgement about where you're going to go in the company and whether or not we like you\". Once you show your hand, your reputation is cemented and no amount of time or change in your behavior will change their opinions in this department. Managers seldom move, Sr Manager never move - so whatever they think of you, is what they think of you. Don't be fooled by the fake compliments, \"Kudos\", rewards, free lunches, or utilization as a \"resource\". If you aren't being given opportunities within a few years, they've already made up their minds about who you are and where you're going within the company.  Like many reviews have said, AFS doesn't really care about your thoughts or opinions. Whatever you do, don't complain. Maybe you can provide \"suggestions\", but watch your tone. Consider your delivery method (face to face, privately, in an office, on the floor, or via e-mail) and how it could be perceived by others. Don't be fooled by the rhetoric of accepting feedback or by whatever response Capital Group will provide in response to this opinion. AFS is interested in one thing and one thing only - support whatever idea upper management comes up with, no matter how silly, dumbfounded, and unrealistic it is. If you work there long enough, you will see a change from one process to another and then back again. Mostly a repetition of previous ideas and processes, wrapped in some new meaningless, see through wrapper. So when you see it - smile and exuberantly praise what a great new and fantastic idea is it. Don't be surprised when the process is changed, revised, or reversed weeks, months, or years later.\r\n\r\nWithin AFS, the department is not interested in leaders. They want followers. It's bred into the culture from Senior Management down. Leaders are too disruptive to the status quo within the department. Original ideas - truly and genuinely original ideas about managing associates or the department - are not really well accepted and if they are - expect them to be stuck within the cogs of reviews, analysis, and clarification. The wheels of change move slowly. Ironically, it doesn't seem that the same amount of analysis or clarification is utilized for some of the initiatives that management push forward to the associates.\r\n\r\nManagers over associates can seem duplicitous. While seeming to care, they are also sometimes the first ones to deliver a negative perception about the associate. Sr managers rarely take the side of the associate, mostly because of limited interaction. So be aware that if you want a new perception from your Sr Manager, start having those one on one meetings with  your manage and include the Sr Manager in those meetins. Also, think about setting up maybe quarterly check-ins with the Sr Manager to help develop your interaction and career. Again, be careful. This approach while seemingly almost necessary is a double edged sword. Also remember to have your \"work face\" on - be prepared with clear ideas that you want to convey, don't get too personal, emotional, or passionate about anything. There are some managers that really do care and support their associates. But there are seemingly more that are only interested in pushing their career objectives and answer to their boss, that it makes the good ones difficult to identify. \r\n\r\n The greatest incentive they offer and keeps you tethered to the job, is the retirement plan. 15% of your gross income. That being said, I would encourage you to leave on your own terms and don't sit around wasting your time for 6 years for the retirement plan to be vested before leaving. While it is a great benefit, it's also one of the major incentives to stay, but remember, it's not your money, so anything you walk away with is free money. Other companies may offer matching or better overall compensation packages if you know what you are looking for.",
    "Slow to promote. Raises may be tiny at first.",
    "They claim to be transparent, but are not.",
    "Upper management put too much faith in 'Senior' and lower management.",
    "Management can make you feel like you are a dime a dozen\r\nTraining is not consistent with each new team hired\r\nTeam Managers and some associates are afraid to interact with clients during escalated situations",
    "There is an underlying current of hierarchical BS that runs through this department.  You are encouraged to challenge the norm, however when you do, 85% of our leadership (senior managers and above) is quick to overpower you in a way that hinders creative thinking and mutual respect.  Sr. Managers will tell you that we have to encourage an environment of individual/team growth and mutual respect, but these leaders are quick to throw each other under the bus and bad mouth some of their peers to their teams.  Not professional and doesn't set the right tone for the potential future leaders of this organization.  You can complain about any one of them to the HRLT and they will do nothing to stop the unprofessional behavior of some of these senior managers.  Some of these leaders are \"besties\" so it's almost a moot point to even bring up an issue because nothing will change.  Most of the Sr. Consultants and Consultants will never feel safe to speak up about what really goes on here (Irvine and LA) and that's sad, because then we resort to these anonymous Glassdoor reviews which will be reviewed by a person or two that is actually part of this toxic group of senior managers.  They will discuss how they just received another review of someone who is just trying to complain and that it's ultimately irrelevant.  It has happened before and again, HRLT will do nothing about reprimanding some of these senior managers and directors for their bad behavior and poor leadership skills.  The proof is the turnover in the last year.   We have a large HR community compared to the size of our organization, but it's still concerning to see great talent walking out the door because of poor leadership.  A robust compensation and benefits package will only keep people for a period of time before they decide that it's not enough to keep them here.  I don't provide referrals for employment here anymore because the environment is toxic.",
    "Back office (7.5K of the 8K employees and contractors) is decades behind other work places in terms of IT systems, quant capabilities, and so many other areas.  It's all about having a big team think of reasons why something cannot be done.  If you hired 200 good people to replace the 7.5K rules based people who are all into coming up with reasons why things cannot be done, you could lower feees for clients and have better systems, but everything is about how many people you manage, how you protect your team, and silo based thinking.   At some point when investment results are bad management will figure this out, but it will take time.",
    "I can't think of any downsides. It's a great company!"

    "Its a good company to work in for a comfortable 9-5 job. There isn't a great chance of being fired for under performing. Generally the benefits are good and two free travel passes is beneficial for people who have working partners, saving them yearly travel.",
    "They protect their employees, fair and consistent and very good salaries."

  "cons": [
    "There is a lack of leadership. There doesn't seem to be a strategy in any department and people are not conscious of the fact that the company runs on the publics money so every penny should be spent sensibly. The unions dictate things to the management and the management bend to avoid conflict. The management is too old school and need to be bought out of the stone age in to the current era. Lots of people add no value and leave things to the 11th hour,",

I love engaging with the residents and hearing their laughter makes my day complete. Some residents like to have quiet time with me, others enjoy music, dancing and storytelling. I very much enjoy finding activities that each resident enjoys and will tailor make activities to suit them.",

    "A number of staff members in the Fashion department have ulterior and spiteful motives.  If they don't like you they will gang up against you to make you fail and sabotage projects and tasks that have been set.  There is little or no support from other staff members or departments including the line manager or from the HR department who are even condescending towards you if you ask for support or help.  Staff will stop at nothing to stand in your way to progress; for me, they even used a bereavement that I suffered months before my probation was due to be completed against me!  \n    Everyone covers each other up so it looks like nothing is going wrong but there if you look closely you realise the schemes that go on.  I received no communication from my line manger during the final few weeks of my notice period.   At times when I tried to cover up for her wrongdoing I ended up paying the price.  From my experiences, if you are hard working, this is a place to avoid at all costs, especially if you are offered a full time job.  Others staff members who have had to start working there from a part time or temporary basis will not like it and try to sabotage your progress because of their jealousy!  \n   Also, done expect the HR team to support of help you at all.  They favour and even protect permanent staff who have been given the chance to pass their lengthy probation period.  When you’re on probation you’re treated like muck and if you do anything to upset staff in the department they sabotage your chance to pass and work there.  Inaccurate information is passed on about you and you end up wasting you time, effort and energy on people who don’t even like you.  The staff turnover is really high and how I was treated explains why.  if you’re bold enough to actually apply for a role here as about this at the interview!",

    "Totally chaotic with a complete inability to plan further ahead than the next week. The majority of projects do not have proper plans or schedules.\r\n\r\nToo focused on reviewing costs without any understanding of the engineering solutions that are driving said costs. Costs are often reduced on senior management whim without any sound rationale as to how the reduction can be achieved or how the project/product will be delivered with reduced investment\r\n\r\nSignificant numbers of the management community exhibit poor and outdated business behaviours, which is ironic given how much emphasis the annual review process and interviews give to good business behaviours\r\n\r\nCulture is very reliant on who you know rather than what you know. This can favour the politically savvy rather than the genuinely capable\r\n\r\nVery little thought given to business processes. What processes do exist are outdated, inefficient and poorly documented. There is a culture of bypassing processes and, as a result, every project and department operates in a slightly different manner. This only adds to the general chaos.\r\n\r\nSilo mentality and culture between departments. Each department protects its own interests. Departments often expend more time and resource blaming each other for problems, rather than working together to find solutions. This can be particularly frustrating if you work in an area of the business responsible for integration\r\n\r\nMeeting based culture means that many people spend the majority of their working week in meetings, leaving very little  time to actually do real work. Meetings often duplicate one another.\r\n\r\nUnrealistic deadlines are regularly set by senior management,  resulting  in work being submitted which is incomplete of incorrect. This often results in tasks being completed multiple times, inevitably taking longer than if a realistic deadline had been set in the first instance.\r\n\r\nThe matrix based organisation means that the decision making hierarchy is unclear. Every issue, no matter how trivial, requires the involvement and buy-in of numerous individuals which slows progress. \r\n\r\nDecision making responsibility is not delegated meaning that the majority of decisions are made at a senior level. This creates two issues. Firstly, many senior managers seem incapable of making decisions and just request more information. Secondly, many lower grade employees feel little job satisfaction due to the limited impact they appear to have on the final outcome.\r\n\r\nEngineering and project management can feel very amateurish. Little documentation is produced and that which is produced, regularly lacks precision. Many topics are investigated multiple times due to the fact that the first investigation or decision was not documented.",

    "IT division is very backward. The issues stem from the senior and middle management. Most make huge efforts to avoid taking decisions and responsibility. A few are very keen but end up loaded with so much pressure that they can only focus on immediate priorities, so overall there is very little planning for the future and very little innovation, it's all firefighting.\r\n\r\nToo many of the management are not from an IT background at all - JLR prefer to recruit internally so they take people from mechnical engineering, management or even production line backgrounds.\r\n\r\nHuge reliance on contractors because of the lack of specialist IT skills. Some are great but others do very little work and stay for years on great pay.\r\n\r\nLots of red tape - the worst I have seen. The processes are rigid but often not best practice.\r\n\r\nHuge use of offshore Tata Group consultancy for development. Individually some developers are great, but many are grads who are trained to standards 10 years behind best practice. Collectively it is poorly managed. Timescales are rarely met and communication is poor, but they are not held accountable as they will always be used next time rather than going externally.\r\n\r\nBecause of the above issues, many projects go around for years, at great expense but never getting anywhere. By the time they come around again, the original people have left and everything is repeated. Factory staff rightly have huge distrust of IT for this reason, and work around the IT processes, leading to further problems and difficultly engaging.",
    "Very bureaucratic and slow in working",
    "Treated like a slave.\r\nRacist management.\r\nno concerns for your health or safety.\r\nnot allowed to the toilet.\r\nSexual harassment is a daily thing.\r\nTold how worthless you are on a daily basis.\r\nNo pay rise for 4 years (only pay cuts) yet top managers received a 30% payrise.\r\n8 hours constant work, only 2x 15 min breaks where you have to walk 3 minutes each way to a rest area.",
    "No work life balance, if you hate your family, pets, house or free time, then work at the EMC Wolverhampton. You get to be in work for 8 hours to the second, with the threat of a 3 hour extension or a Saturday with just a couple of hours notice, with shift work it also makes you so fatigued to do anything with the little time you do get off. If your lucky enough to work in machining you get the added bonus of excessive noise, minimum 85db plus and a sickly choking vapour of atomised oil in the air. Management have yet to grasp the concept that there is a word called 'no' to the bosses above them, though they dish it out unsparingly when asking for favours like time off to look after a sick child or dying relative. Covid does not exist at JLR and if you are stupid enough to catch it, then you are disciplined for threatening the profits the company are desperate to make.",

    "Highly political work environment with fake processes. Decisions are not for the best of the long term future but rather for short term share price improvements.",
    "Very top heavy management with few leaders that demonstrate exemplary role model behaviour. Lots of in fighting between divisions which trickles down from the leaders. Very wide job grade salary bands, but once you get promoted to the next grade, it's exceptionally difficult to rise up through that band, you tend to stay at the bottom until the next promotion.",
    "Closed minded/ignorant managers who've never worked anywhere else and probably wouldn't make it in the real world. Masses of miscommunication, stubborn hirearchy"

    "The global business org at Google struggles with its flat organizational structure; it can be difficult to get promoted or to have your work acknowledged in a very competitive, self-promoting culture. Don't believe everything you read in the press about how fantastic Google work culture is. Although the HR department has made multiple attempts to improve the promotion structure at Google, it can be near impossible to navigate all of the appropriate politics to gain a promotion. Furthermore, a promotion in the sales org at Google does not necessarily mean an increase in responsibility or a title change. Employees usually work in roles 1-2 levels above them in order to first demonstrate that they are worthy of promotion. In this same vein, the opportunities for growth are VERY few within this org, and you often find people moving from industry to industry (within the sales org) to keep their day-to-day interesting. There is a huge bottleneck for middle management to make their way into leadership positions. Most importantly, the leadership within the sales org is severely lacking. Leadership makes decisions well removed from the sales organization itself (and its employees) and often work like politicians to further their own careers, rather than improve the larger organization itself.",

    "- very low pay for the area - my recruiter literally told me my offer was considered \"below a livable wage in the bay area\", however I also had no room to negotiate based on experience ..lesson learned!\r\n- unfair / biased hiring practices - theres at least one lawsuit in recent years alleging unequal pay between male and female teachers. I can confirm I knew of at least 1 male teacher who was hired as a level II when every female teacher I knew had been told by their recruiter they *must* start as a level I regardless of education or experience. I knew of at least one peer with a Masters who had to start as a level I - $16/hr. I am confident the male teacher did not have the same level of experience.\r\n- unfair promotions - all about who you are friends with. if your team is a sinking ship you will likely go down with them at performance time regardless of your own individual performance\r\n- HIGH attrition due to all of the above. constantly understaffed and making huge crazy sacrifices to stay in ratio \r\n- used to give stock options at hire - took them away without telling the population. huge uproar when everyone found out, followed by walk out protest and calls for raising base pay based on market standards. told by google leadership \"we know educators being underpaid is a problem, but Google is not going to focus on that right now\"\r\n- few growth opportunities - only 3 levels of teacher when I was there in 2017, otherwise like a handful of operations and leadership positions. \r\n- base pay is bad but promotion compensation was worse, a slap in the face. when I was promoted from a level I to level II teacher (the 2nd of 3 levels I could aspire to, remember) my raise was literally less than a dollar + a few stock thank god, and my manager actually acted like It was a big deal. I cant really blame her, knowing now how some companies manage promotions and $$ when It comes down to It, but that was just insulting..for the both of us. not unusual for educators, especially in preschool, but Google sets their own standard high and when a company is always preaching how \"employee first\" they are you kind of get to hold them accountable to it in practice.",

    "At a time of crisis it can often be quite divisive, at Sage it has been incredible to be part of and observe the care, kindness and genuine concern for colleagues and customers that Sage is extending, during these unprecedented times of COVID-19.  The sense of pride and trust I feel is remarkable as I watch the business continue to \"Do the right thing\" by everyone.  Steve Hare is the most authentic and inspiring CEO I've worked for and is the beacon of positivity for the company. The UKI business is doing everything to support colleagues and customers alike under the leadership of Sabby Gill with constant communications, collaboration and support.  My Manager has been incredibly supportive which has enabled me to continue working even with the challenges of 2 young children at home, being stuck at home, conference calls, emails, cats seeking attention and oh trying to fit in a workout!! a BIG thank you to Sage.",

    "Management, lack of HR to support employees, and lack of direction. The Management in many of the departments but especially IT are severely lacking. They would hire from outside the company, hiring management that had no skill in that management and no experience in that department. Employees who excel at their positions and talents are constantly ignored and not treated well. Just a warm body filling the position is all you will be good for. Do not dare having a difference in opinion or valid reason for the different opinion. Disgusting treatment of good strong employees! Human Resources that don't back employees but the agenda of management and the good ole boys club mentality.",
    "Low pay for performance; no movement in upper ranks; easy to get pidgeon-holed;",
    "Not much to vent about really.  \r\nI think as the labor market in certain areas (specifically in the Technical space) continues to tighten, Sage needs to try to stay more competitive in salaries - both when trying to get top talent in the door as well as when trying to keep top performers from leaving",

    "Culture of high turnover, poor morale among staff. Training not as advertised, horrible culture from newly incumbent management and wholesale change removing everything that used to be good about the company. Salaries below the market average for similar roles. Culture of hiring more staff than required and winnowing out the rest as fast as possible. Avoid like the plague.",
    "None at this time :).",

    "None at the moment to comment about",
    "- A lot of change to keep up with",
    "Management is detached from the employees.  C level execs in North America have a bullying attitude at times and manage/lead by intimidation.  Sage as a global enterprise is a HUGE mess with just about everything being separate, specially management, between operating companies in different countries which makes it impossible to implement enterprise projects, with the exception of C-execs pet projects.",

    "None as i could think of. Good software and managers.",
    "Slow to change, lack of connection with other company software/locations",
    "Absolutely unattainable quotes for sales team.  Example: in one particular division they were 3% over AOP (5% over previous year in actual revenue), yet sales reps are lucky to hit 50% of quota. In a horrible economy this division is still hitting numbers given by corporate yet the sales reps aren't getting commission checks because of a steep deceleration built into quotas. To top it off this particular division raised the quotas by at least 15% over the numbers corporate set.\r\nManagers are not promoted because of their management capabilities but instead on who they can hire at the cheapest salary or (like many jobs) who they know.\r\nSage is not interested in hiring the best or keeping high performers.  I've personally seen a handful of employees leave a division because of frustrations that could have easily been resolved with leadership.  That crippled their ability to deliver services to customers as well as sales reps ability to sell, so they had to outsource the work that ironically was (and still is) done better than their own staff.\r\nSage keeps expenses low by running what would be considered skeletons crews at most businesses.  \r\nMany employees do the work of two people, yet there are others that do half the work of one person. Why? It is VERY hard to get fired from Sage. Therefore, they have a lot of people that would have otherwise been fired at other businesses.\r\nInternal processes are lacking or don't exist. \r\nSome divisions lack basic tools do to their jobs (i.e. a true CRM for sales reps). How does a company that owns a CRM not have it available for their sales reps?  Oh yes...a proprietary CRM named Atlas has been in development for 5 years and has yet to be delivered.\r\nCheap cubicals that dampen sound about as good as cardboard boxes.",
    "Management can seem too target driven, technical support role requires employees to push sales and keep to KPIs, sometimes at the detriment to the level of support that could be offered.\r\nWell meaning initiatives from higher management can lose their meaning when implemented by team managers on the floor looking to get the right figures. \r\nProcedures in place to help teams work together but more work to be done.",
    "Bad management, this is a company full of employees just worried about CYA. Sage still suffers from the legacy of Ron Verny. Whereas he was focused on acquisition -- no one was focused on building Sage as a great place to work.",
    "Poor planning and poor travel time",
    "Never worked in a place with such half effort when it comes to training, no support no knowledge",
    "bad to travel long diatance",
    "1. Some senior managers are lacking in knowledge of modern business practices. One of which is they do not consider marketing of their products. 2. Most of the product lines are supported in India and Philippines and are encouraged to sell the products even thought Sage has a well seasoned Sales Depts. 3. Those same products are also sold by consultants for dramatically reduced price on the web. 4. Most sales representives cannot make their monthly sales goal.",
    "To many hierarchy that reduce productivity.  \r\nCant retain people with product knowledge, people comes and goes.\r\nDon't see career growth in the position.",
    "•  Food options around the office are limited\n•  Tough to get to via Transit",
    "Although Sage matches your pension contribution, companies I've worked for in the past pay a certain percentage regardless of the employee contribution, whereas this isn't the case here.",
    "Stretched way beyond capacity not only your position but continued company realignments & restructuring lead to delays in personal & business communications/actions. Be prepared to pave your own way on a career path outside of the company as promotions & individual recognition is extremely limited, outside of Sales.",
    "Sometimes the global aspect (hours) can get tough.",
    "Our customers, while normally agreeable, can occasionally be very difficult to deal with.\r\n\r\nManagement has a strong tendency to bloviate about positive change while doing very little to effect that change.\r\n\r\nSome of the applications which agents are hired to support are extremely challenging to learn. Despite long training periods, retention of new contractors is very low. Out of a class of 20+, 1-5 might be left after peak season.\r\n\r\nLow contractor retention results in severe understaffing, which has historically caused 3+ hour phone queues.\r\n\r\nSupport staff are commonly either excluded from company-wide meetings slated as \"all-in\" or are pulled early to take calls or chats which have piled up as a result of management's refusal to close support queues during these meeting times. Contractors are regularly excluded altogether from these meetings and most campus activities.\r\n\r\nIncreasingly frequently, management has taken the opportunity to encourage everyone during meetings to submit positive Glassdoor reviews. As a result of this, there have been a surge of very positive reviews placed by management as well as a surge of very negative reviews from current or former employees. The decision I've made to publish this review is a result of these transparent attempts by management to solicit positive reviews.\r\n\r\nThere are significant discrepancies between what tenured agents earn and the starting salary of new hires, such that new agents being hired consistently earn more than their counterparts with years' more time and experience with the company. This is not to say that new hires should make less, but that management should be proactive and make sure that they are awarding adequate raises to those who decide to stay with the company.\r\n\r\nDespite having changed the format of the survey form which is sent to customers after calls to clearly differentiate between the customer's satisfaction with their interaction with the support agent (OSAT) and their satisfaction with Sage as a company (tNPS), performance metrics have since been adjusted so both questions impact the support agent. If the customer you assisted is extremely satisfied and ranks their interaction with you as a 10, but gives Sage as a company a 1 because they are unhappy that wait times were too long or that their support plan is too expensive, (both things that an agent has no control over and may not even be mentioned on the call) that 1 is still reflected on that agent's metrics.\r\n\r\nSoftware as a Service (SaaS) is a toxic and consumer-unfriendly business model that Sage is placing more and more emphasis on as it becomes the norm in the wider market.\r\n\r\nManagement has placed a continually increasing burden on support staff to generate sales leads. This means that, despite customers calling support for help, they will end up being offered training, additional licenses, expert services, and anything else management feels can be shoehorned into support conversations. (Do you enjoy calling your ISP or cable company about issues with your service only to be asked if you want to upgrade your plan?)\r\n\r\nWhile management insists that lead generation should only be undertaken when it is a good fit for the customer, this is contradicted by their mandate that a particular percentage of interactions must be a good fit in order to meet rapidly rising performance metrics. For perspective on just how rapidly these metrics are increasing, in the few years I've worked here, they have increased from 4 leads per month (a flat amount) to 21 leads per month (average of 300 calls per month multiplied by an expected ratio of 7%).\r\n\r\nAs other reviews have stated, consistency of quality of managers is extremely hit or miss. There are some managers at this company that genuinely elicit trust and respect - not only from their reports, but from those on other teams. Unfortunately, some (or more accurately, most) of the management team does not live up to this standard. Here is a short list of particularly egregious examples of a single manager's (reported and ignored) misconduct: outright refused a customer-requested escalation, tried to imply that sharing one's own salary information was illegal, and downplayed reports of inappropriate touching and staring by older male team members (on multiple occasions,) even actively meeting privately with and discouraging those affected from sharing their experiences. Even ignoring all other issues discussed here, reporting to this individual is what makes me dread coming to work each day.",

Assistants there should be looked at Project Coordinators due to their workload/exposure to projects. Middle mangement for support departments are horrible and incompetent - there are no reprocussions for unprofessional behavior by upper management. No accountability for middle mangement when they lied in mid-year reviews of assistants.",
    "Slow promotion, zoom fatique, too extroverted",
    "There's was a substantial disconnect from upper management, and our division.  It felt that there was no clear vision statement from the company at large.",
    "Benefits are not very good",

    "My interaction with my team members was largely virtual, so it wouldn't be a good situation for someone looking to hang out with buddies after work all the time."

    "I found it to be kind of boring.  Then again, there were times when you were doing a million things at once",
    "Favoritism,secret shoppers who lie,low pay and no life. Managers that constantly critisize amd bully and harass employees about their job. The property i work at is terrible it's so bad that a diamond member complained and management had to try to kiss his ass and bribe him. Dusty and dirty rooms,mold on the ceilings on most rooms,1970 interior green paint,cracked,loose and missing tiles. Housekeeping almost never changes the sheets. I have witnessed this on multiple occasions. Constant workplace stress and bullying by managers. Cannot advance at all. Good hardworking employees don't get any recognition what so ever. Lazyness and favoritism is awarded so much so an employee recieved employee of the month twice! Employees cannot defend themselves if acused or blamed for bs that did not happen. The employee has no rights it's always the fuest first employees non existant. Employee put on the spot instantly is wrong take guests word over yours. Mundane and repetetive tasks carried out on a daily and nightly basis.",

    "Very busy energetic office environment with lots going on, demanding but great team.",
    "meeting a lot of interesting people \r\n8hr shift pattern on mobile services\r\nmandatory training",

  "cons": [
    "This company does not care for its employees with its shocking low wage, everything you do is timed from going to the toilet to taking your 1 break of  half hour from the 9.5 hour day, they then send an email to the whole team naming and highlighting  how many SECONDS each person dare to be late back with constant threats of being file noted. Everyone is emergency taxed for at least the first 2 months and then have to prove that your owed the money back.",
    "Very demanding & often stressful place to work, you definitely have to be able to work in a fast paced office.",
    "Long hours or breaks in between service users. Only allowed to change your availability once a year",
    "1) Three months after I'd started , they introduced a uniform for call centre agents even though it's not a customer facing job - however, all the other teams and departments could continue wearing what they liked.\r\n\r\n2) They took away individual tea breaks as apparently we couldn't be trusted to make our own tea. Instead, we had to have a rota with one person taking a turn to make drinks for the whole team. And if you want the toilet, you have to ask permission like a kid at primary.\r\n\r\n3) My team leader could be nice when it suited her, but a micromanaging bully on other occasions - if she didn't like the way you were handling a phone call, she'd talk at you so you couldn't hear either her or the caller. I don't know how many times I asked her to write it down. She would also put you on the spot and belittle you in front of colleagues if you made a mistake, then send out hypocritical emails to the team telling us not to do this to each other, which none of us had.\r\n\r\n4) Some tenants and landlords get really abusive on the phone, and you're not allowed to object or stick up for yourself, you're expected to not only sit and take it but \"kill them with kindness\". I got told off for not being \"empathetic\" enough towards a really rude landlord (I was struggling to be sufficiently polite and not rude back!) I walked out when management wanted to have a meeting with me after I'd stuck up for myself when a tenant got particularly nasty.\r\n\r\nI have given a two for work life balance, because despite having decent hours, you end up taking work stress home with you.",
    "not being listened to\r\nunfair pay structure\r\nheavy workload\r\nbullying \r\nno incentives or prospects to improve / promotion\r\nground hog day"

Worryingly they think they are top leaders and they are destroying everything and everyone around them. The MD epitomises everything which is wrong with the company. A dinosaur. With zero emotional intelligence."

    "Great atmosphere and vibe in the place, a lot of experience to call upon and management are very respectful towards all staff.",
    "Huge potential just need to tweet the process",
    "Been very engaged during lockdown, having fun with colleagues! Well looked after regarding pay!",
    "Really enjoy my job and the people I work with. Great Opportunities to grow your skills and career.",
    "I'm digging deep. Absolutely none",
    "Good benefits package, satisfactory salary, high prospects for getting promoted, 4 on 4 off work pattern gives you good social life.",
    "Great atmosphere to work in with lots of chances to progress through the business.",
    "Working for CarShop has always been a pleasure, fantastic training from day one and constant support and coaching. This company has never been the one that just 'pays the bills' for me. I have only recently decided to review them myself due to them raising the bar during the coronavirus pandemic. Wherever I look, whether this be friends, family or social media, there are so many people struggling and this inevitably causes doubt and anxiety. I can now safely say that CarShop have truly delivered in providing myself and my family with the reassurance and financial backing we so desperately needed in these unprecedented times. The health and wellbeing has been proved to be of their upmost concerns and the plans they have shown to keep colleagues safe upon our (eventual) return to work only cements in my mind the care they have for our current and future colleagues."
  ],
  "cons": [
    "I have been working at CarShop full-time for more than 2 years.",
    "Not many bad words to say!",
    "Long hours, poorly paid commission for the motor trade",
    "It’s hard work and long hours but I love it, if you don’t like that then you may struggle.",
    "Bullying, narcissism, nepotism, lies. Back stabbing",
    "Long hours, sometimes adverse weather conditions, have to search for cars in a large car park.",
    "Can't think of anything - its hard work and challenging at times but targets are achievable and its great for anyone with a strong work ethic, the ability to remain positive and the determination to succeed!",
    "Can be long hours but pays off.",
    "The only downside to working here I would say is sometimes the hours can be unsociable. However, this has never been a huge problem for us as a family as balancing work and life is a struggle in most jobs nowadays. On the other hand, any other business in this trade I believe are just as unsociable and in most cases, more unsociable. For example, working weekends is a must in all motor trade outlets I have encountered, so no major negatives"

    "Good customer service, strong employer work ethics, strives to improve the environment for the external and internal client. Every day is varied and different, its never boring",
    "Property Management can be a tough, unforgiving and thankless industry to work within. For this reason, many people float from company to company, hoping to experience something different. \r\n\r\nThe reality is, the work does not change but the environment you work in, entirely makes the difference. Rendall and Rittner, are exemplary. They hold their employees to the highest standards and in return, reward you with a nurturing, respectful and positive environment to work within. \r\n\r\nThe leadership team are authentic and attentive which has been really showcased during the Coronavirus outbreak. The company responded and adapted with lightening speed. Employees were set up for homeworking and they ensured that those in need, had items from desktops to chairs delivered  very quickly.\r\n\r\nThe directors provide company updates each week via a live broadcast and commendably, allow questions to be put to them at each session from employees. They are honest and open in their communication not over promising, to ensure they do not under deliver! \r\n\r\nThey also recognise the importance of mental health and even though we are on lockdown, have engaged everyone in non-work related activities from a 5K walk, to a company quiz. \r\n\r\n If I sound loyal and dedicated, it's because I am!",
    "I am lucky to have been with Rendall & Rittner for over 5 years and have witnessed the company go from strength to strength. The support we receive from all levels of management is outstanding and everybody really has a passion for their roles and duties. This is further aided by an active in-house training academy. The company is very open to career progression. A great company to work for, evident from the low turnover of staff and numerous awards received."

    "Nothing the company can help but Coronavirus has prevented a lack of direct contact...",

We were like slaves and pack rats just going day to day working aimlessly\r\n+NO voyager at my property EVER rotated to other departments like we were SUPPOSED to do....they said they didn't think it was necessary (then why put it in the program directory?)",

So even if you are full-time employees, you may only work 4 days a week, or one time they even told me work on call...excuse me, full-time position, it's not casual.\r\nlow salary, but a lot of paper work to do, sometimes no break.\r\nPoor training system, they want you work like you already knew what to do even if you are a new employee. When you made mistakes, they blame you.\r\nWeird internal relationship. They hire employees internally (not outside candidates) by how good relationship you have with supervisors/managers, not based on how many skills you have or your background.\r\nSome lazy old employees, they might work for Marriott brand's hotel for long time, but they are very lazy and trying to bully new people.\r\nHigh employee turnover rate.\r\nCustomers are always right, Employees are always wrong even if you do things correctly based on logic.

Marriott requires employees to have a 30 minute unpaid break if you work 6 or more hours in a shift, however if you don’t have time to take your break, they will still take out 30 minutes equalling 30 min of unpaid work. Another issue I’ve ran into is my PTO payout. It’s been over a month since I put my two weeks in and I’ve called HR multiple times and they don’t have any answers for me. That is 64 hours of pay they are skipping out of. I’m about to get lawyers involved. Do yourself a favor and skip Marriott.

    "Where to start. The company has no value or respect for any member of their team. The company used to be about upskilling staff to allow them to progress into higher positions whereas now these positions are filled from external candidates who often waltze in on a much higher rate of pay than long standing members of staff.  Dental nurses are paid a embarrassing rate of pay considering the effort and time they put in. Practice managers on unjustifiably low rate of pay in relation to responsibility. Every day team are expected to work well into lunch breaks as heaven forbid we don't hit an impossible to reach 'run rate' for targets although the problem is that there is not an adequate amount of dentists to cover the targets as let's face it what dentist with a performer number in there right mind would come work for the company. Justification required for every penny spent in practice. Funnily enough we asked for amalgam because we need it to treat our patients. Practices are bought then left to practically rot as they are too busy investing in more practices. Dental nurses and managers expected to cover at other practice miles away for no extra pay and a ridiculously low milage rate. Good luck asking accounts for your mileage back you will be greeted with this is wrong or that is wrong, any excuse to perhaps delay getting your expenses back. Extra responsibilities and workload constantly piled onto the team with no reward or even a simple thanks. Quick to extend opening hours or open on weekends and expect staff to be able to drop the rest of there life so if you have a life outside of work this is not the ideal company for you. You are expected to constantly train new members of staff for surprise surprise, no additional rate of pay! Do you see a theme here? Higher management are bully's and play games as if they are still in the playground. Nobody with half a brain would trust them as far as they could throw them. The best thing I did was hand my notice in.",
    "Bad team work, was ignored and and any questions I wanted answered was responded with too busy..I had a couple of reviews then was out.. with no warning of not doing well. \nUnfortunately they need to work as a team in order to succeed I feel this is not the case..and if your face doesn't fit you're out. \nVery rude as well. Some people could use manners."

    "Staff are friendly , work well as a team & I enjoy spending time with residents.",
    "FSHC is a lovely company to work for! They are considerate to personal circumstances and always aid their employee's anyway they can.",
    "None, place is terrible to work in",
    "Colleagues and management alike want to offer the best care possible to residents.",
    "Excellent communication and opportunities",
    "The residents are great, that's the reason I go to work!  The management team at my current Home are reasonably supportive."

  "cons": [
    "Management are bullies and treat the workers like dirt.",
    "Experience at Livingston Care Home has been shocking!  If you're not super speedy and rush the residents then you're classed as \"lazy\" I like to actually spend time talking to the residents and take proper care of them but seems that's not what this care home wants you to. Unfortunately still working here but wouldn't recommend the place to my worst enemy!  Night shift staff encouraged to have residents up as early as 5.45 to try and make life easier for the day shift, shocking!",
    "Large company you can sometimes slip under the radar and do not always get recognised or rewarded for your hard work.",
    "Can sometimes have poor staffing levels which means agency are called in to help or left short handed.",
    "Sometimes workload shared unequally",
    "Pay is poor, no benefits such as sick pay.  A culture of favouritism and hiring a number of employees from the same families.  The work is heavy, not enough hoists or equipment.  Bullying is tolerated.",
    "Management are well-intentioned and care about providing good care, but no amount of good intentions are enough to allow for every duty to be performed. Staffing just isn't adequate for that. This forces carers to compromise on their values in an effort to finish as many duties as possible in a shift."

I worked for almost 2 years next to someone who regularly showed up at least a half hour late, often took two 1-hr lunches, and accomplished in one month what each of two consultants regularly accomplished in 3-4 days.

One consultant was eventually let go (the other luckily found a job elsewhere).\r\n- I haven't seen much desire from management to do things \"right\". \"It is what it is\" is the most common saying -- systems and processes are faulty and rarely get fixed.\r\n- Seemingly a black-eye on your resume, including the low salary.

    "The coop knows nothing of work life balance, the way it treats staff is unethical and a disgrace. Constantly cutting staff hours, you feel physically ill by the end of your shift. No time to take proper breaks, manager expects too much and doesn’t care.",
    "boring shifts with no change",
    "Unpleasant employees in management positions.",

    "Due to the amount of good services we offer work can be pretty hectic.",
    "All too often, rules change without warning and without proper communication. The rota is now scheduled by a flawed automated system, giving you really weird, largely unpredictable shifts. Despite filling out an availability form, you can still get hours given to you that conflict with your agreed availability. Training has become somewhat haphazard, with new starters knowing the basics, but being clueless on how to actually achieve targets correctly. And communication, which has to be mentioned again, is lacking heavily! Being part time, I rarely know what's going on or why because no one takes accountability to ensure that I am informed. Sadly, this also includes the scheduling of hours, as I often find the rota gets changed and I don't find out until last minute, having to either cancel plans or having a surprise few spare hours, or random day off that I previously thought I was working. Being autistic, these issues affect me more than most other people as changes in my routine can severely impact my well-being.",

    "physically hard work, company going through lots of changes so had to learn new things all the time",

Usually one person on the till while one or two others stock shelves. At busy times even three people on the till isn’t enough.\r\nDo not get full hours break when working 8+ hours. They give you 30 mins. I was told to notify the team leader if a staff member took over 30 mins (which I didn’t do because I knew how long the staff member was working that day and was entitled to an hour.\r\nA lot of shop lifters and no security guard.

    "The pay isn't great. Even with a pay rise coming up we will still only be a tiny fraction over the minimum wage as that goes up every year. We promote healthy eating yet never have fruit or veg on promo it's always chocolate and wine and pop and cakes, keep that but add healthy stuff to it as well.",
    "Big organisations are slow to adapt.",

    "Appreciation for planning, effort and development; clear leadership in sales and wider company; decent benefits commensurate with workload.",

Since then, Colt has provided me a number of opportunities which has helped me grow my career in the right direction.\nColt encourages its employees to enhance their skill set by providing access to platforms such as Coursera and LinkedIn Learning.",

  "cons": [
    "too many silos - but this is being structurally addressed; poor systems - a lot of manual processes; sometimes a lack of accountability in service delivery & service management - but can generally get leaders to respond when needed.",
    "There are chances were you can be stagnant in the same role for a duration longer than you expect.",
    "Global company not offering many opportunities to work abroad, too many log-ins and systems",
    "Slow internet connection at times, but aware it's being improved"

Management talks, big and grandiose, we're awesome... but of the 12 guys on my team I was one of 2 that hit their number (which tells you that either quota's are too high or my manager make poor hires).  Turnover on this team is very high - 9 of 12 have left in  12 months.  Why?  On my team the manager is weak, there is no direction, focus and engaging when a deal needs to be pushed either internally or with a customer. He seems oblivious to the fact that so many on the team are not hitting the numbers and he is not digging in to find root causes.  It may well be the absolute lack of onboarding process (that's as it was when I climbed on board 3+ years ago and that has been a source of frustration with new hires) - solution training or even something as basic as who your solutions architect is and, there is zero collaboration with other team members.  I was told by one team member when I was new that he would not help me because \"there is nothing in it for me\".  Other team members sell solutions other than yours and they call on the same accounts.  Their objective is to take the customer's budget before you can - too bad.  Customers have zero lack of trust and the only reason they buy Oracle is because with the \"red stack\" everything integrates on a code level.  So that being said, at a recent company meeting I was talking to a higher education rep and he shared that they typically give a 96% discount off of list and, depending on the situation they may shave another point or two. Tell me why?  Is it because sales doesn't know how to sell the value so they sell price? No wonder the poor guy was complaining about having a hard time making a living.  And by the way getting any kind of pricing approved is absurd with the different applications you need to access that don't easily share data/information.  To illustrate how dysfunctional the organization is, when I climbed on board and I needed access to Oracle's CRM tool so I could climb into my accounts quickly I had to get approved by Mark Hurd's office and that took 4 months - I had to be approved by the president's office and it took 4 months!!!  And the information in the tool, well it was almost non existent because other team members refuse to provide information or insights about customers that may help you take the customer's money and therefore commission money out of their pocket. In a nutshell I think the leadership is anemic, weak and frankly doesn't care.  The old school managers who have been with the company for 15 years are riding the gravy train.

    "Less hike\r\nVery manager centric\r\nNo extra curricular activities\r\nLess exposure to technologies\r\nVery slow growth",
    "Poor to no career plan\r\nInternal HR management sucks, you are basically on your own\r\nSuch a large company that adapting to organizational change is very slow",
    "Not much of communication from higher management.",
    "No growth. your skills wont be competeble enough in the job market after working here.",
    "very little salary increase year by year",
    "No chance of promotion. No salary increase for 6 years. \r\nTerrible culture all the way down from Larry. \r\nTerrible senior mgt in APAC (we now report into HQ via Europe).\r\nLarge staff turnover and they just don't care, they let good people go all the time. They have no loyalty to staff).\r\n\r\nWorst company I ever worked for....but I'm still here. I don't know why (you'll hear that a lot in Oracle).",
    "The downside is probably lack of promotions and raise. Promotions are very hard to get since there are so many to do list that need to be checked off, especially in ST.\r\n\r\nSince the company is big, you may feel your contributions are not significant since you mostly work only in small part of the product. But thats to be expected from big company like Oracle.",
    "Acquired by Oracle. Who knows what the future will bring. Not possible to act like a startup. Benefits don't look as good. More career opportunities?",
    "if you are promoted to a new position, less chances of getting a pay raise due to an HR policy",
    "low pay for existing employees",
    "sometimes people think oracle is oakley",
    "1. Manager Centric\r\n2. No Increments",
    "In my group, we were overworked and underpaid. Moral was low. Raises were extremely hard to get. The work was demanding and rewards were few. The absence of raises or bonuses was extremely hard to accept when the company as a whole was doing well and the CEO is one of the top paid in the industry.",
    "not one of the higher paying tech companies",
    "Oracle can feel over-whelming at times but when you understand the culture and challenges, this is very manageable."

It seems like everyone is always walking in the same direction towards the same goals - we are truly obsessed with customer success. \"Your success is our success\" is not just a generic moto written in the walls to keep people motivated, but what's demanded from each and everyone of us every single day. \r\nNo easy for company with 50k+ employees to have such a great alignment. And it's true, maybe there will be some misalignments here and there, but all in all, I can just say how proud I am to work for a company that appreciates such noble values. \r\nOnboarding is overwhelming - specially if you're in a sales position, but the opportunity to connect with great people, learn from the best professionals in the industry through a structured enablement methodology is a great privilege. \r\nAs any sales department, people will fight over deals or accounts, but Salesforce has taught it all: processes have been put in place to avoid conflicts and make disputes easier and fair. \r\nWhen it comes to innovation, it's literally at the center of everything we do. Salesforce is always 10 steps ahead of the market, planning the next tech hit or next move.",

Customers are typically willing to discuss and engage with you based on our reputation alone. \r\nThere are some highly intelligent and capable people right throughout the organization. This means that projects and evaluations can become very creative and the standard of work is typically incredibly high. It is by the far best place I have worked in terms of learning from those around you. \r\nThe benefits are second to none, including health insurance, gym membership, fertility/adoption allowance, generous maternity/paternity leave, a degree of informal flexi-time. \r\nThe offices are decent, with fresh fruit and snacks available. \r\nThere are a wide variety of career options available, both internally and also externally due to the expanse of the Salesforce ecosystem.\r\n\r\nAltruistic culture runs right through Salesforce and is truly \"lived\" as opposed to being just talked about.",

I never thought of myself as a leader until I got this opportunity, so thank you, Salesforce!\r\n\r\nI think it's also why the majority of employees are are not only talented, but great people (albeit predominantly white). \r\n\r\nThe CRM technology works and it's super exciting to work at a company that's so innovative (even after 60K+ employees, countless acquisitions, and 21 years in the biz).\r\n\r\nThe benefits and pay are top notch (I love being able to pay my bills - hooray!)\r\n\r\nC-Suite leadership that can acknowledge their mistakes (I'm lookin' at you, Brent Hyder!), and seem to genuinely want to make things better. I would also say the same about the leadership within my operating unit, for which I'm grateful, but that is not consistent throughout the company. \r\n\r\nIf employee success actually reads this, I will totally list them as a pro (although the daily emails always make me smile, so I guess that's a pro as well).",

There is a system in place that you tap into for lead generation, upselling accounts, prospecting, and events. You have a team of people you sell with from product experts to solution engineers.

    "- Inequity of pay\r\n- Inconsistent comp plans",
    "A culture of bullying and backstabbing from the top...\r\nMicromanaging and lack of trust.\r\nSuccess is not determined by your ability and/or hardworking, but rather by sales pacth/territory you are assigned to.",
    "If you are a contractor here you don't get treated as fairly",
    "The fast pace can take time to adjust to.",
    "Only been with the company for about a year, so nothing here yet.",
    "Salary is too low\r\nProjects depends on availability due to consultancy",
    "It is good to have a lot of measures for success, but still need to work on making sure they are accurate, such as adjusting annual team goals when there are open positions for periods of time.",
    "Work Life balance is not the best.",
    "Upper Management are misaligned with Eingineers",
    "Pressure! You will face a lot of Pressure + Politics. If you holding any offer other than this, Please prefer other offer in Hand.",
    "*Highest performers in the commercial space seem to be most adept at structuring contracts - not necessarily at creating business impact for customers. This feels like a symptom of the Oracle influx in recent years\r\n*The mega-growth is great, but the growth necessitates faster promotions and shrinking territories. This creates a unique burden on often inexperienced management to evaluate sales talent subjectively. Subjective decisions on promotions and territory carving - even when correct - often creates discontent among individual contributors who believe they've been evaluated unfairly.\r\n*Promotions happen quickly, and therefore require individual contributors and even first line managers to spend more time managing internal politics than delivering value to customers.\r\n*Commercial customers often have 2-3 different AE's (account managers) per year, which can make it difficult to establish a relationship. The result is that even great customers view Salesforce as a vendor instead of a partner in their growth.\r\n*Selling into the enterprise space is exciting at Salesforce, but sales talent turnover is staggering.",
    "Remote onboarding takes a bit of the excitement of exploring Salesforce, feeling welcomed and connecting with colleagues.\r\nNew hires may feel it's too much information and too many things to digest in a short period of time. Trailheads, Astro Courses and Online Sessions can be very exhausting and too theoretical. Having AEs, Managers and colleagues sharing real-life experiences in a fire-side chat can be a great way to learn new things and practice some of the concepts discussed.",
    "Not any cons - happy there. Good environment. Great people and managemt.  I think myself lucky to be working there. Keep up the good work",
    "Nothing is wrong as such",
    "There is a real lack of cohesion to the sales organization. When you first join you are pretty left to fend for yourself and see to your own integration. \r\n\r\nThe sales targets are completely ridiculous and the compensation plan has been making it more difficult to make money every year. This year I am going to make approximately €25-40k (depending how my year finishes) less than the average of my last two years. The overall attainment figures for sales people are in the toilet. This will not be made clear during your interview and will not be openly discussed with management as to what a realistic quota should be. This ultimately has created a toxic environment where people feel undervalued due to their inability to hit an unrealistic target. In theory, everyone can make good money. In reality 90% of people will miss their target and the majority of commissions will be left in the hands of the few. \r\nThe increasing product offering of Salesforce brings problems in terms of collaboration. It is not always easy to find the right person for the right meeting in good time. This can make it difficult for customers to do business with us, as the sales process can become protracted. \r\nWhile career options are varied, the criteria for promotion isn't ever clear. It is often a case of 10 people interviewing not knowing how many roles will be filled, not knowing when they will find out and unclear feedback as to why they did/didn't get the role. Naturally this has caused people to question the process.",
    "Almost the same as the \"pros\".\r\nVisionary company, CEO lives 5 years in future.\r\nWas a disruptive force, but is now normal.\r\nIntense culture, not a place for 9-5 behaviour.",

    "Oracle managers change culture\r\ngrowth is danger to culture",
    "Work/life balance can be a challenge",

    "Cultural misfit/challenges with company aquisitions.",
    "- Not necessarily a con but a little disengaged from the rest of Salesforce in other buildings--employees need to put in an extra effort to be/feel part of the main Salesforce office around Chicago\r\n- Lots of change organizationally but office leadership is mindful of how this impacts employees and is actively working to make these changes more understandable and transparent",
    "Micromanagement, poor leadership.\r\n\r\nComplete shift in culture over the past couple years. After the acquisition everything went downhill.",
    "So many salespeople  are in here.",
    "I had a super rocky start at Salesforce and my experience is extreme but not unique: \r\n\r\nI had 4 managers within 15 months, starting 6 weeks into my Salesforce career (90% due to poor luck), and by the time I had my 4th I felt demoralized and completely incompetent. Personal brand is everything, and if you don't have a manager that's going to support you in this regard, you should start looking for another job. Thankfully lucky manager number 4 recognized how I was feeling and got me into a much better place. As of this year, I'm happy to say that I've never felt more supported or appreciated. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, not every employee has the chance to turn things around, and get the Salesforce experience that the company sells. I fear that this is especially true for our employees that are not white dudes (not to say that they haven't had issues as well, but like many things in this world, the impact is disproportionately on our URM and female employees).\r\n\r\nOver time we're putting fewer and fewer resources into customer success, and while it hasn't affected the business yet, it's only a matter of time.\r\n\r\nRecruiting is a nightmare to work with - I've never had my referrals treated so badly, and it's so embarrassing, I've given up.",

    "lack of middle management training",
    "Poor quality of work, no learning, bad for career growth",
    "Honestly not many that I can think of. The NYC office has great leaders and great AEs.",
    "Very difficult to explore new opportunities if you're in the creative department. There's a real absence of leadership and management talent there.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere has been incredibly negative and political for the past 3 years, so if you're interested in another role you'll need to leave the company (you'll be given that advice if you express interest to your manager). \r\n\r\nThe department is purposely trying to become an ad agency, except the department leads don't want to partner with other teams and are openly adversarial when they're not in front of execs. The department leads set a bad example by frequently talking trash about colleagues outside the creative team and that doesn't help anyone. \r\n\r\nIf you're considering leaving your agency gig to take a client side role, this is not the place you'll want to call home.",

    "The \"culture\" at Salesforce is extremely toxic. Everything that they do is purely lip service. Their work life balance? There is none. Diversity, do they make diverse hires? Sure, are you welcome into the office? No. How do they keep getting such great reviews? Take a look at the reviews, most of them are from employees that are 6 months or less. Right after you attend training(which is great) you are sent a survey to rate them on Glassdoor. You are on a high from training and have no idea what you have gotten yourself into yet so you give them 5 stars. Fast forward if you are an AE you are given your territory that has generated virtually no revenue from the year before or was oversold by the previous rep(you are then stuck with handling customer service issues due to poor implementation) and a number that is impossible to reach. Multiple times a week you are required to have a 1:1 with your manager to go over this territory where you are trying to make lemons into lemonade. Nepotism and favoritism runs rampant here. They allow other employees who have \"put in the work\" aka been there the longest to get the best territories and therefore they are hitting their number and eligible for promotions. The irony of this is that they are also tasked with training new employees where they have the attitude of \" pull yourself up by your bootstraps\". They are little to virtually no help because Salesforce fosters an environment where you personally have to be #1. Anything or anybody that could interfere with that is seen as a threat.  I could go on about how terrible of an experience this was for me and I also recognize that this isn't everybody's experience as well. However I would be lying if I didn't cringe every time I see articles talking about their next initiative.",
    "If you have worked for a true global technology leader (Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, SAP, EMC, etc.) don't waste your time coming to salesforce - they want you to be sitting in a cube all day and they mean it, you need to report your hours in and out for real, the accounts/territories are really bad; what they call General Business Corporate accounts are really SMALL to Mid-size companies - and if you get what they call Mid-Markek  well good luck because will be literally selling to 50-employee companies. They (their executives) openly lied to me during the interview process to lure me into the role and and the end the accounts/territory I received was a total disappointment, and if that was not enough: I was given a territory totally different from the local territory we discussed and they ended up sending me to sell to states in a completely different region of the US in a different time zone. I'm out of here!",
    "In my case, I was working almost 4 years for this company and I resigned because I was suffering from Workplace Harassment from part of my manager with the fact of employees' success wasn't able to resolve an internal conflict and finally you finish resigning. I think it one of the principal disadvantages, some managers are not prepared to be managers and they're promoted only because they had a couple of years working in the company. Also in the interviews, they promise that you will work with the latest technologies in the market but in the case of my position I never touched Kubernetes, and SRE is only limited to monitor PagerDuty alerts and NewRelic boards.",
    "Rather large employee base to get to know your coworkers.",
    "This is one of the most ridiculous team that you can see. This is one team that acts completely against the company’s core values. Leadership team is new and they want to impress the team in US and so they drive useless initiatives just for the sake of it without thinking about the current problems that the team is facing. Numbers driven mindset who doesn’t want to hear the problems at all. Call for a meeting and only they will talk. No time for them to listen to the problem on the ground. They think they are absolutely right and they can drive things like how they have done that from their past companies. All actions are numbers driven and more consultant company type execution (authoritative) so as to get the results. They need to understand it's not Wipro, Infosys, HCL or even Deloitte. \r\nNobody can speak up freely. If someone talks then they will hold the vengence against them and show that during promotions/salary hikes. Half frontline managers coming from similar experience will go behind the VP/Directors to get their needs fulfilled. Couple of the managers will jump on to other team’s business, pretend as if they are all over the place but in reality trying to show-off. They have hardly 6-7 years overall experience and show-off as if they are 15+ years experienced. Regardless the upper management wants only that type of front line managers who would just nod their heads, sweet talks and tell yes to all they say. The upper management will even promote such inexperienced people who doesn't really deserve or doesn't even fit to be in the team. Bad working attitude and thinks he is the superstar of the whole support team. \r\nThey will call floor meeting and say promotions is only merit based but have special reservation only for people. All the merit system is all brainwash and every time they change their own words, no honor in that. If you want promotion/hike then you need to run behind them like a dog and loose your self-respect. \r\nHardly there are few managers who have concern for the teams and have the guts to stand up against these immature leaders. For those one or two managers they would have tough time thereafter and eventually they will also change or quit. All talks that they talk about Company culture are only virtual. These managers with service industry mindset driving this like a call centre and don’t care of people or their feelings. \r\nIf you are just looking for some good money and care less of your self-respect then go ahead and join. Ask for the shift and if its night shift then don’t join. Night shift has the worse management team, politics and groupism at all levels. \r\nIn short, good company being spoiled by some upper management from these tier2/3 companies who has no understanding of Salesforce business nor has interest to do some good except for themselves.",
    "Frequent reorgs, lot of M&A activity",
    "It is extremely hard to think of any cons at the moment since I am brand new to the company. So far so good!"

  "pros": [
    "Very friendly culture; various challenging projects; nice professor",
    "I didn't find any pros to tell about this company,  Incase you want to work for free or get a salary of 6,000 less than a watch man job. you can choose",
    "Friendly atmosphere, comparable salary to similar roles at other universities. Opportunities to develop within a role. Excellent city to live in.",
    "After giving this some thought, I still cannot come up with a single pro of working there.",
    "Great colleagues, smart and engaged students, good employer. Glasgow is a fantastic vibrant and green city; there is a lot going on, so equally good for young people as for raising a family.",
    "I've experienced great leadership at College and School level. As someone with a new young family, I feel very supported and accommodated.",
    "Work/life balance was good and working hours were flexible.",
    "An academic career allows you to guide research and sometimes gives you enough time for you to do some  yourself.  Unfortunately unless you bring in millions of pounds in grant month your time is not valued and you are overloaded with too much admin duties and teaching."
  ],
  "cons": [
    "The administrative management is not good. Nepotism trumps merit. Bullying of administrate staff is widespread and goes unpunished. Career progression is not possible.",
    "salaries will not be on time,\r\nmanagement team is worst,\r\nno growth in the company\r\npeople working from 5 years also don't earn more than 25K \r\nonly half salary will be on papers and other half they don't give to cheat government and that will cause problem to you also.",
    "Not much mentorship if you're on a temporary research only contract. Limited opportunity to be promoted within the University. Very dependent on the relationship you have with your direct line manager which is fine if you get on, less so if you don't.",
    "Poor pay, huge workload, no extra pay for working late, no opportunities for career progression.",
    "Short days in winter\r\nBureaucracy can be a bit over the top",
    "would be better if provided more funding. \r\nFor challenging courses, should provide TAs.",
    "It is a large institution which has its own challenges however senior management and leadership structures within the Colleges and Schools appear to work hard to minimise these.",
    "Most areas of research are underfunded by the EPSRC which means that the senior management at the University of Glasgow penalise the majority of staff for not securing millions of pounds in funding.  As a result they overload these member of staff with too much teaching and admin.  For these staff members they have to undertake research in their own time.  This leave very little time for life outside of academia.  Also, the salary for lecturers, senior lecturers are very low.  Makes it very difficult to raise a family."

    "here the salaries only not good",
    "Not any I can mention",
    "Toxic leadership, unclear promotions, unclear job descriptions, racist promotion decisions, lack of credentials by new hires and internal promotions, they basically pay less for employees to do more based on who they know in the company. Inverness employees from previous contract seem to be hiring each other from within the new contractor, Serco.\r\n\r\nNon-compete has agreements not to poach or hire employees who currently work or have ... may lead to civil and even criminal liability under federal or state antitrust laws; however it seems they are recruiting employees from other contractors. \r\n\r\nInstead of improving on quality of employees and compensating current and valuable/loyal incumbents, leadership allows for all of this to go on under their noses. It's disgusting and misleading for applying candidates especially military spouses and veterans/retirees who do not get the proper training or proper compensation. \r\n\r\nBless the service members of all branches who are suffering under this new contractor. Department of Labor should be ashamed.",

    "There are so many things that I dislike about working here now. The supervisors are vindictive, upper management treat the General Clerks like cattle. They just cut our hours to 32 and then moved up the deadline for a forced schedule change to this weekend with 3 days notice. There is an ever present fear that you will lose your job every few months. If you work here, work until you find something better",

Multi-billion dollar government contractor won't pay workers adequately. Little to no training. No work/life balance-occasional Saturday work turned into Saturday or Sunday work several times a month without offering overtime, AWS or telework option. No attempt to rectify the situation by management. Minimal support from senior leaders. Company recently took away tuition reimbursement option claiming that this will help \"offset\" the costs of Obamacare. Disillusioned and disgruntled, I stard lookingt",

    "Salary is very low.\r\nNo great increment:",
    "understaffed and over worked\r\nhigh turn over rate of employees yet the training is 2 months long\r\nthe company only cares about the numbers and no the soldiers/clients\r\nIt's all about how fast you can get a soldier through the program even though they may be homeless or unemployed\r\nEach counselor has a caseload of 300-500 clients and working lunchs are considered normal\r\nyour schedule becomes booked completely for months out and there is no overtime\r\ncompany doesn't care about family or holidays. You're required to work on chrismas eve, the day after christmas, the day after thanksgiving, and new years eve. If you don't want to work then you need to take vacation time but you only get 10 days of vacation time per year.",

    "As in the Title the people are fantastic, it si an company where you can get stuff done without being dragged into the politics to much however if you are a political animal it has plenty of games to play !  \r\n\r\nThe offices in Kingswood are fantastic with great facilities including a pool, gym and loads of pitches for all sports.  Good canteen and coffee bar and very clean and well maintained, car park can be interesting at times but overall 5* for a working environment. \r\n\r\nBenefits package is always good, especially and unsurprisingly the pension is fantastic."

  "cons": [
    "There has been a lot of change in recent years which has a negative impact on staff moral but as an outsider I can still see what a great place to work L&G is. \r\n\r\nCommunication from managers to staff has always been an issue and I belive this is still the case."

Just horrible.",
    "I worked in a VERY small travel shop inside a hospital. I was the youngest there (16 at the time), yet all the older ladies treated me with respect. My first manager was a young/ish man, who was fine most of the time- but was often a bit inappropriate towards me. Probably should of reported it, but I was very young and naive. Nevertheless, he left and a new manager was put in place- and to put it politely- she was a bi-polar cow! Always nasty, and never had anything nice to say about anything. Expected the world from her employees, but never did anything herself.  Wasn't that hard to run a tiny shop, by the end of my time working there, I could have done it! Also, was excused of doing things that I had never done (won't go into detail!) but was very horrible to hear that people would think I would do that - I believe it was my age! Would of reported it if I was older!",
    "revolving shifts, late shifts (3pm-11pm) often not finishing till near 1am\r\ncoming out to your car in pitch dark, not very safe late at night\r\nhold up on motorway if an incident had happened",
    "Runs on skeleton staff at all times. Always short staffed with overtime required just to be able to open advertised hours.\r\nSales assistants expected to work at supervisor level with minimal training and for minimum wage.\r\nInconsistent approach to resolving problems.\r\nManagement attitude of 'if you don't like it, leave' creates an atmosphere where staff feel unable to raise concerns.\r\nNegativity - jobs well done are never mentioned but small errors are highlighted.\r\nSupervisor positions being phased out means very little opportunity for progression.",

Number and length of breaks varied between people in the same job and with the same pay, including some employees getting paid breaks and others only getting unpaid breaks. No holidays allowed during busy period, eg. Christmas, summer holidays, Easter etc. They prefer to halve your hours and hire someone else to work the other hours, so they can cut back on paid breaks. You only get 1 uniform to wear all week.",

    "Lack of chairs for employees at the tills so you spend hours on your feet.\r\nThey don't listen to customer or employee feedback regarding being offered the vouchers or items at the till. This often results in employees receiving backlash from customers, or in the kinder customer case, simple annoyance and waste of paper resources.",
    "Stores can be very short staffed which can make it stressful",
    "16 hour contracts, lack of staff, expected to often do the work of 2 people, Management are often too busy to pass on information to staff, the work itself can be very repetitive, lack of avenue for progression.",
    "Underpaid & overworked .. completely ad hoc run always reacting NOT proactive \r\nbare minimum staff",
    "The people you serve as they are typically quite rude and unsavoury. Time off was pretty flexible too.",
    "-Store manager and management in general were highly unpleasant people\r\n-an example of a rude comment made by assistant manager was about my skin, which I felt was totally innappropriate, rude and unprofessional\r\n-i felt poorly informed about holiday, and my training was minimal\r\n-worked there for 2 years and remained on 4 pounds an hour which is shocking \r\n- In the time I was there I had 2 absences due to migraines. For this, the manager put a warning in my file and asked me to go to the doctors which is ridiculous \r\n-worst experience of my life, couldn't have been happier to leave\r\n-put off retail work",
    "Not a good wages compare to work",
    "Lack of communication \r\npoor salary",
    "Learn good things but see the bad picture also",
    "The amount of responsibility dumped on you over a short period of time often doesn't match the pay or position you have been hired for.\r\nThe managers will sulk over every lost penny, and even asked everyone employed to put together money to make up for a 20p loss in till change (yes this happened).\r\nCustomers are extremely entitled living stereotypes, if they bring an expired coupon that you cant use because its expired they will make your life hell, the manager will then come out to reprimand you for not helping them. On the other hand, if you DO use the coupon it's on you to take the blame.",
    "terrible pay and attracts some very strange customers",
    "Annoying CO workers And Hard hours",
    "Barely any shifts. Average pay. No reward system.  Boring with nothing to do but wait for your shift to finish.",
    ". Awful management - I had in effect two managers who didn't communicate with each other, leaving me struggling to do what was asked in the time available.\r\n. Staff are generally treated poorly e.g. I won a competition for selling discounted chocolate, however when I went to claim my prize (a gift voucher) they claimed no knowledge of the competition.\r\n. IT system looks like its from the 1980s; sticker guns constantly failed, causing frustration.\r\n. Hours of staff set up so as to prevent staff taking a full break.",
    "long hours and difficult customers",
    "Head office impose tight turn around times for setting up new ranges and promotions, and often seem to spend 4 hours setting something up one day for them to change their minds the next. They're shops are an embarrassment to work in, given the poor state of upkeep and repairs, and in many cases stores are left with only 2 members of staff on the premises at one time (often to try and cover more than one floor!)",
    "Store manager can be a pain, does nothing at all and pretends to do work. Gives most of his duties to the assistant manager."

    "I look back and think that no real positive impact and nothing over any other company I worked for.  Infact  probably not one of the better ones at all. Leave entitlement was ok.",
    "A lot of interesting work and Kier is a market leading business.",
    "Great projects to work on, lots of large scale civil projects\r\n27 days holiday + bank holidays\r\nAnnual salary reviews",
    "Progression within the work force",
    "The team I worked with made my time at Kier worthwhile",
    "Good environment and people, comfortable office and flexible office hours",
    "Get to work with some talented engineers.  a wide variety of projects - keeps things interesting and constantly challenged to learn new things. Opportunities to get invaluable construction site experience.  Encouraged to become a chartered engineer.",
    "Absolutely none at all - awful company.",
    "the support i get from my team is the best",
    "Good variety of work on offer",
    "Decent work life balance",
    "One of the best salaries/perks for a graduate civil engineer\r\n£1.5k welcome bonus (included in 1st paycheque and subject to tax [wasn't aware at the time])\r\n£1.5k relocation bonus (similar to welcome bonus, but not guaranteed)\r\nCompany car (be aware that this affects your tax-code)\r\nHopefully there will be room to move around"

    "Be aware of the difference between being site based and office based, because subsistence and other perks vary quite a lot \r\nCurrently not feeling much of a \"support network\", with such a big company you can be left to your own devices",
    "Salary not reviewed in line with the market, leads to employees looking elsewhere for promotion and recognition. The amount of work that is expected of employees is far above what can be done in the time available.",
    "Low rate of pay\nManagement discourage development \nFelt like working for 2 different companies - HRSS vs the rest of Kier\nCommunication is horrendousfor such a large company",

    "pay could be better.  pay is not linked to the annual performance review at the moment.",
    "Unethical, no transparency, treats contractors and all employees terribly",
    "there is literally no cons",
    "Lack of holiday days only 21 pa only select few move up ladder",
    "To many.  Poor systems, silo working, poor communication, poor induction and it just goes on. Very clique organisation and political with empire building and infighting.",

    "Paid throughout the pandemic even when isolating",

    "Nice colleagues. \r\nGood bonus.\r\nRelaxed atmosphere.",
    "Lovely team, supportive managers and there is always to something to learn.\r\nAs a Business Analyst, every day is different.\r\nThis position gives you the opportunity to understand and have a vision of how an investment bank works.\r\nYou need to be proactive, self-orientated and passionate about data that's for sure.",

    "Used to be good. The company recently announced an extra 5 days off after you have served a year. This is the carrot to keep people from jumping off the ship.",
    "Excellent Company Benefits \r\n- Enhanced Maternity Pay\r\n- 25 Days Holiday with option to buy a further 5 days\r\n- Cycle to work scheme / Help paying for public transport \r\n- Lots of employee discounts \r\n- Generous pension scheme \r\n- Healthcare plans / benefits \r\n- Discretionary annual bonus \r\n\r\nGreat offices / location / facilities \r\n\r\nGood team for the most part",
    "People are friendly here and there are quite an amount of opportunities for career progression and growth. Depending on your boss, you do get a knowledge of the department's plans for you.",

  "cons": [
    "There are better companies to choose.",
    "Culture is a bit backwards here, younger employees are put in a windowless room. The company doesnt practice what it preaches when it comes to workplace strategy.",
    "Poor leadership across the board. Seriously lacking direction. Staff turnover and most quality people have left the business.",
    "Company benefits quite basic. Not much affordable food choices around the HQ office.",
    "Hard to promote with people being there for years",
    "- Often felt like a number in such a large company \r\n- Impersonal relationships with managers / senior staff\r\n- ‘Us Vs Them’ barrier between staff level employees & above \r\n- Little room for professional development. More often than not, people seem to be promoted to ‘associate’ after 3-5 years of glowing service. This appears to be a method of making people feel valued with a shiny title & meagre pay rise. These roles seem to be generated to keep people happy, as the responsibility of this ‘progression’ doesn’t seem to change an employees responsibilities that much. If anything, openings for such a role actually breeds a very specific teachers-pet kind of individual\r\n- No flexible working (for most people)\r\n- Cliquey culture \r\n- Blame culture \r\n- Old fashioned company values \r\n- Training not great from the start\r\n- One set of rules does NOT apply to all",
    "However, culture differs from department to department, and hence you would not know too much before joining if you have the long or short end of the stick",
    "Not very busy during the summer",
    "micromanagement and highest I have ever seen staff turnover"

  "pros": [
    "- If you enjoy meeting a lot of friendly and helpful people then it's a great place to work. \r\n- Feel like you're giving something back to the community with the services and advise Citizens Advice provide. \r\n- Every day is slightly different and challenges are often in abundance so it's rarely boring. \r\n- Relaxed environments. \r\n- Good interconnected national network of people and resources - useful when local staff and volunteers don't know the answers.",
    "able to help people in community",
    "Great supervisors and work colleagues.",
    "Good training available, supportive environment and managers are generally grateful for your handwork.",
    "As a law student, this is an excellent volunteering opportunity to learn about things practically and help clients. Lots of soft skills to be learnt, and you're trusted to do tasks fairly quickly, but you will have help and supervision when needed.",
    "People generally care about their work snd clients",
    "good company to work for",
    "Wage, no latest or weekend work.",
    "Friendly and warm colleagues\r\nFair and equal rights workplace\r\nSatisfying job helping the public \r\nRelatively complex workload and stimulating/challenging",
    "Nice people who really care about the work they do"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "- Management tend to have their own agenda's and are increasingly resistant to change or suggestions from non-management. \r\n- Very poor communication between management and staff! There is a 'crystal ball' culture that  everyone is very aware of but seemingly just accept. It does cause a lot of problems though!\r\n- Paid staff benefits/or perks are basically non-existent! Free parking is at a premium at most offices and often paying to park in public car parks is the only answer. Paid staff aren't entitled to claim parking or fuel expenses for travel; there is no overtime or any way of earning extra money and performance incentives don't exist. \r\n- Training and support (incl. tools and resources) for IT staff basically doesn't exist! \r\n- IT within local Citizens Advice don't usually have 'IT Teams' or departments and normally local organisations employ a single IT staff member to service the needs of several offices. Some local Citizens Advice locations don't employ IT staff at all.\r\n- Technology infrastructure (PC's and telephones etc) are often old (very old) and budgets to improve systems are unrealistically small making stability and improvement extremely difficult to implement. \r\n- Lack of understanding by management regarding IT means that IT systems are often viewed as low priority - hence the incredibly small budgets. \r\n- Reactive approach to a crisis rather than proactively taking measures to avoid the issues in the first place.    \r\n- (Not really a negative but....) People believe that Citizens Advice is a single-operated organisation. Citizens Advice is one organisation but is operated by individual regional or town based teams with their own sourced funding and budgets - almost like franchises! This does cause some confusion as practices and services can differ depending on the region.  \r\n- Lower than 'national average' salaries for many paid roles. \r\n- Internal employee progression paths aren't clear making it hard to aspire for a higher position than what you currently do.",
    "Terrible managerialism \r\nPoor customer service",
    "Limited funding  and sponsorship.",
    "Sometimes longstanding, older volunteers can be overbearing and territorial",
    "The supervisors on shift are very busy, and it often involves lots of waiting for the supervisor to review your draft to be sent. The role is unpaid unless you specialise, which takes around at least 6 months+. There are other paid roles though. You volunteer, so you don't get paid.",
    "charity organisation lots of training",
    "Focuses more on hitting call level targets and data input on forms rather then the advice given. No team morale",
    "Poor management that has been promoted a few too many times",
    "There aren't any cons to working there",
    "Lack of a well structured training programme for new starters"

    "I am a mum of two and love working as an Executive Assistant but working full time and travelling to the office everyday can be stressful and exhausting.  Working as a self employed Virtual EA has its benefits but without a guaranteed income it isn’t financially viable for me.\r\n\r\nWhen speaking to other mums and carers I’ve become aware that there is a large pool of talented individuals that employers are missing out on.  More and more people are working virtually now and an EA should be no exception but you just don’t see many companies recruiting for a Virtual EA.  That’s why I was so excited when I saw the role of Fyxer because they appreciate that you don’t have to be in the office to be an exceptional EA and offering flexible working for people that have the responsibility of caring for others is the way forward.\r\n\r\nI love working at FYXER because I can do the job I enjoy whilst working remotely and without feeling isolated because we have a team of EAs that provide support to each other and share their fantastic pool of knowledge and skills.  The work is varied, challenging and exciting, I’m continually learning and it feels great to be valued by FYXER and the wonderful clients I’m working with."

I did for different reasons. Citi wants to Tellers to sell more than doing the actual bank telling. You HAVE to refer 2 customers to personal bankers daily, if not, you will get fired after a few months. Referring is not easy and not for everyone. They trained you on how to \"sell.\" As a Teller, you will get pay a lot less than a Head Teller; more like 9-10 dollars a hour. Also, as a Teller, Citi makes you go out and seek out \"clients\" to come to the bank to see a personal banker so that they can rip-off the people.

Employee surveys explicit reflect that there is a culture of fear, arrogance, and white is right.  McKinsey and Deloitte clones run the organization.  Look at the lack of racial diversity of the organization, especially within leadership. How does one justify this?"

  "pros": [
    "Healthcare vision is amazing!\r\nThe business is growing rapidly.\r\nLots of highly skilled new Senior management hires helping with maturity of the business.",
    "Company mission and climate. A fun place to work.",
    "The company values and culture is getting much better! I'm here for more than one year. I lived some ego bad thing, but now everything has its own mature argument. The processes are also improving a lot. It's a hard challenge which I'm liking a lot! 💜 health care accessible and affordable to every one on earth 🌎",
    "People from all walks of life work here. It provides for an inclusive and diverse work environment. There’s a strong emphasis on collaboration. It’s always fun working with colleagues from different departments. It exposes you to a side of the business that you normally don’t get to see. Management have doubled down on their efforts to recognize the accomplishments of their staff. This has had a massive impact on improving morale.",
    "Working on something that has never been done before, challenging environment that pushes you and your development, brilliant intelligent people who become great friends.",
    "The company's mission is genuinely very good, and it's what drives me and many other people to do our best and gives us a sense of accomplishment. People are usually very nice, and there's not as much office politics as in other places. Remuneration is fine, but only that.",
    "Will try to be as neutral as possbile and skip the Cons part and write everything up here. Criteria I will use: Mission, People, Culture, Management, Product, Company Outlook\r\n\r\n- Mission: without a doubt amazing\r\n- People: I'd say lower average bound. Worked with a few really smart engineers, but a lot are just bad/incopetent/slow/unmotivated/political (yes political engineers..)\r\n- Culture: relaxed, but I guess depends on the team you're in and how high up in the ranks you exist. Working hour wise, again depends on the team, but really anything goes. I've seen people doing 9-4.30pm without any complaints and those people weren't great performers either\r\n- Management: again, depends.. I've seen both, good and bad. I have seen some tech leads that should have been junior/senior engineers and of course the other way around. Same with engineering managers and engineering directors.\r\n- Product: I am a bit more opinionated on this topic. I think if all the products were spun up to separate startups only GP at hand would survive, everything else is just not working. Having said that the product suite overall has potential to be great, as it does collect data about your health journey in various stages, ie data collected when you're healthy (health check, monitor), data collected when you're sick (AI, GP at hand) , and with all this data better diagnostics and healthier lifestyle decisions can be made\r\n- Company Outlook:  this is where I'm the most sceptical. I think Babylon has a valuation of a tech company (it raised 500mln recently) and is valued ~2bn. I would argue that it's not a tech company. First of all, the only product that is great (in my opinion) is GP at hand, which has a high cost  base (doctors, support, engineers to support the system), AI/ML stuff just does not work, even though there are smart people working on this. Let's be honest, GP at hand is nothing new - it has been around in the US for some time, it does not change the healthcare experience much (you can get an appointment quicker, but the doctor consultation is also much more limited) thus there's nothing really exciting about the tech. So what we have is a great mission, average people, average culture, average management, weak product and hard times ahead. I cannot be anything, but sceptical about the future of the company. I hope it succeeds because the world needs a better/integrated health care system, will that be Babylon? Time will tell.",
    "Role here is really what you make it, if you enjoy a fast paced working environment full of challenges, with a strong company vision, then its right for you!",
    "- Surviving here means you’ll probably do alright elsewhere. \r\n- Some of the smartest and most motivated people you’ll ever work with, sadly let down by senior leadership. \r\n- Free breakfast.",
    "If you hate native iOS/Android development you will have an opportunity to learn React Native stack.",
    "- unique opportunity to work at one of the fastest-growing businesses the UK has ever seen\r\n- super smart people\r\n- great global mission\r\n- this company wants to go places and isn’t interested in small-scale growth\r\n- well-funded business which won’t fail due to lack of funding",
    "Some really bright and lovely people \r\nCool projects to work on\r\nNice location \r\nWorking on tech which helps people",
    "My most important pro for Babylon is the mature and experienced senior management. They really stand out compared to other start-ups. There's also the relaxed office with snacks and drinks and the benefits package which includes the app, options, and private healthcare. The company is changing and growing very fast at the moment and I think it's for the better. I find the people quite interesting and friendly. There is definitely a spirit of friendly cooperation -- you generally see people that love what they do. And last but not least -- Babylon has a mission that is actually important and can make a real difference in people's lives. That does matter in the long run when you look back at what you've accomplished.",

  "cons": [
    "Plastic plants\r\nUnmanageable workload still growing\r\nHiring to “blitzscale” and replace constant stream of leavers",
    "I think the company is still figuring out quite a few things and changing rapidly. This is generally a good thing and their ideas and direction are great but it does create some difficulties along the way. There is a very clear vision of where do we want to go, but the way there is not always as clear (I guess it never is). It is also a little more corporate than the average startup.",
    "As a fast moving environment, the processes needs to be improved so fast. Sometimes appears that there's no process in place. In other hand is just a filter in the point-of-view of who see it: it can be a reason to complain, or can be an opportunity ;) \r\nThings here changes fast, for better. Everyone here needs to be detached enough to follow these changes, and also preferring the improvement perspective. \r\nIt changes fast.",
    "Genuinely [mostly] lovely people but give it time to 'really' get to know there reasons for being lovely it may just be for you to take on their work whilst the Work From Home (ON ALL CHANNELS) 2 days a week.",
    "- the pace of change can be hard for some people to keep up with - this isn’t somewhere you want to be if you want a predictable environment \r\n- employee churn - though if you look at this properly then literally zero people at Director level or above have quit after their probation period. Also CEO has people working for him since pre-Babylon days which means they must have confidence in the direction of travel and ability to work for him\r\n- you will be pushed to deliver. Exciting for some people, intimidating for others",
    "Due to aggressive cost-cutting and ongoing switch to RN half of native mobile engineers were laid off, quit or on notice. The rest are actively looking for new jobs because pretty much no one really likes RN and those who already switched to RN hate it. Feels like every other week somebody quits, even leads who were holding teams together for years.\r\nIf this trend continues, most of native devs will quit in the next 5-6 months.",
    "If you are unfortunate enough to work here, you will be exposed to the most toxic work culture you will ever experience.\r\n- no advocacy for team members. Senior leadership are so scared about their own positions leading to a lot of finger pointing and noise and very poor ownership across products.\r\n- no professional development. Don’t even think about it. It’s not going to happen. There’s occasional talk but no action.\r\n- no cohesion between product, tech, clinical teams. Left hand never knows what the right hand is doing.\r\n- Unprofessional behaviour tolerated and allowed to go unchecked \r\n- Poor decision making at senior level resulting in reactionary decisions. No sense of pragmatism. \r\n- incredibly high turnover of staff resulting in skill loss at an unprecedented rate.",
    "Processes are not structured. \r\nOne can make huge impact by defining and implementing operations and improvements!",
    "With the huge growth came many changes. One of these changes is the complete loss of whatever culture we had. It is now a fully corporate machine, where the company does not care for the individual and we are seen as human resources rather than people. They claim to foster personal growth, but any request is immediately met with a refusal. There is a constant cycle of \"yes it's hectic now but it'll get better\" and then it doesn't. Management has been promising greenfield projects and time for personal projects since I joined over a year ago, and that's perennially \"four months away\".  In a lot of cases we hired for the numbers instead of actually considering whether we need or even want that person.\r\n\r\nAlso, at least some of the reviews here are fake. I know this because one of them is mine. My line manager told us we had to fill in reviews to improve our score in order to hire more people.",
    "Management seems very disorganised. Hiring policy is undefined.",
    "As the business shifts their priorities, some objectives remain hazy.",
    "The administrative processes could be slicker but this is to be expected from a company who has gone through this level of growth",
    "Check the Pros section as I like to create my own rules ;)",
    "It has taken some time to get a regular/strucutred senior management team in place",
    "- Extremely fast-paced and high growth - this will not be the right organisation for everyone"

They will treat you like the proverbial brown stuff to get things done fast and cheap - no thought to quality or the people.  Most people that stay for a long time are generally too scared to find another job.  Execs are slippery and 2 faced.\r\nIf I could give them 0 stars, I would",
    "- The myth of the guaranteed job. When Capita, on the assessment day, are presenting the opportunity to you, they are careful not to guarantee that you will get placed with one of their clients, but they operate on the assumption that you will get a job. They talk about your prospective job as if it WILL happen, and it would be a total freak-occurrence if you weren't to get one. This just isn't true. There's no guarantee of a job. A couple of us didn't get placed after being unsuccessful at only a 4-6 interviews. You are then removed from the scheme after 6 months. This is damaging, because you get on the scheme, stop applying for *actual* graduate schemes, and then 6 months later, you've missed the window for graduate schemes and have been kicked out of Capita.\r\n\r\n- The training is barely existent. You have to teach yourself. As long as you're pretending to do work, nobody will bat an eyelid. You can choose your topic of learning - There's no structure of what you will learn. You don't have to prove your understanding of anything you've supposed to have learned. You can turn up and pretend to study, day after day. This sounds almost attractive, until you realise you've spent the last 6 months pretending to watch tutorials on Pluralsight and mindlessly scrolling through guides on W3 schools.\r\n\r\n- Geo-flexible. Capita are not transparent about the sorry nature of the job-security and training (mentioned above) but they are open about your need to be geo-flexible throughout the entirety of the two years you're on the programme. Nevertheless, I feel it's important to touch on how much of a problem this is. You will have to be willing to move anywhere in the UK for two years, not to mention interview anywhere in the UK. They can send you down to London, up to Glasgow, across to Bristol, back up to Edinburgh. All the while, you have to comply. You can't say \"I don't want to work in Glasgow, so I'm not attending this interview.\" without getting promptly kicked off the scheme. Your job may end after working for a client for 3 months, and you'll get sent somewhere else. There's no reason why not, in theory, you could be shifted to every corner of the UK over the two years of the scheme. Capita do sell you this with a \"Most of our grads get placed for at least 6 months at a time\" which is still 4 different locations over two years.\r\n\r\n- Process of getting a job. You submit your CV for the scheme, then have a phone interview, then attend a 7.5 hour assessment day, with coding tests, group exercises (the humiliating \"build the tallest  spaghetti castle you can\"), you then create and deliver an impromptu presentation, have an interview with the trainer. You then may receive an offer, but don't be fooled into thinking you've done enough interviewing to get a job. You then, over the next 16 weeks are sent all over the Country to clients, to do yet more  interviews. I even had to do another online coding test for a client before interviewing with them (although in practice I failed the coding test). It is then when you find out that you went through this whole application process so far, to attain the position of: \"We're willing to send you to our clients to interview\". Regardless of the company, the project you'll be working on, the location, you HAVE to attend all interviews they get for you, otherwise you're kicked off.\r\n\r\n- Total lack of transparency between sales and trainees. This is key because it's the sales team which \"sell\" you to clients. They book you into interviews. They're your chance of getting an actual *paying* job. And there is 0 communication between you and sales. You have no idea if there's any opportunities coming up, or how many clients they're in contact with. You're not even sure what the CV is that they're sending over to clients. There can be errors on your CV (there was on mine), although you have to write most of it yourself. You can be there on week 12, having been unemployed for the last 3 months, not with the faintest clue of when your next interview is going to be (not to mention *where* it will be). You find yourself awkwardly entering the main office and standing over the sales team, politely interrupting them to ask \"Anything coming up in terms of interviews for me, I'm on week 12 have only attended one?\".",
    "The Novus programme should be avoided. Poor graduates get sold a dream. Capita hardly has any clients, the presentation shown has clients which have dealt with them in the past. After months of training you get qualifications which are the only thing you can show from your time spent there.\r\n\r\nYou have to self study and pass the exams yourself. The line managers are useless and hardly there.",

Really. shocking  management team with no people skills. Worse thing is the set 10% uplift in salary for a \r\npromotion no matter what  position you apply for?? All in all not worth wasting your time working for them."

    "- Often too much expectation placed on junior levels of staff. Due to resourcing issues juniors with one year's experience are often doing the work of someone with 3 years. This can have benefits with regards to exposure when at big four you progress a lot slower. However there has to be a balance and often BDO is too much the other way. \n- Reluctance to look beyond numbers and focus on intangibles such as staff morale, motivation etc. Happy to let people go without replacing them without considering the negative impact on current staff. Subsequently current staff end up with too much workload and then they wonder why they leave. \n- Partner profit shares are higher than KPMG on average. The firm triumphs this as a good thing without considering the ridiculousness of it.  Remunerating partners more than a big 4 firm with 5x the overall revenue, that suggests merely a far more unequal firm and is nothing to boast about. Again, they will wonder why talent leave in the face of stats like that.",

It seems they are happy to muddle through with staff complaining every week that their money is incorrect. Since I left mine has also been incorrect for the last 3 months. Head office attitude has been dreadful. They have offered no apology, insist on making me wait forever, and keep deducting more and more from what I am owed. The whole experience has left me extremely stressed. Wages were also very poor compared to the work load. I was expected to undertake the role of Administrator, HR, Deputy Manager, PA and Receptionist all by myself! Despite probation period being 6 months I was told that I would be expected to cover the manager`s holiday period and run the home after just 3 weeks! Just to let you know I had never done HR, Wages or Deputy Home Manager before, which they knew at interview, but unbeknown to me at the time they had already had 3 others walk out just after starting in the same role. ( I wonder why?) My advice - unless you`re a glutton for punishment, or don`t take pride in your work then stay well clear. It`s a shambles!",

    "- Large investment in research facilities and labs\r\n- Wonderful campus\r\n- Opportunity to engage in outreach events and societies",
    "Flexible working hours. Generally nobody does any work so you can get away with anything. They throw lots of money into superficial wellbeing events where you can spend your working day doing yoga and colouring in.",
    "Lovely faculties to work for - keen academic teams",
    "Work with amazing people, proud of what I do, proud of where I work.  Amazing training opportunities..  Apple course fab. Work hard, get flexibility within my role.  Opportunities to perform at conferences, big events, flagship for the university.",
    "A UK system university in China, which contains both culture and features from China and UK, it is not a bad choice for study",
    "Everyone is friendly and competent, also in my experience there was very little office politics to deal with.",
    "great environment for work and advancing as a person"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "none that I can think off",
    "Not sure what I'll be doing a year from now.  Fixed term contracts are really difficult to manage.  Skill people up, then they have to leave.",
    "Workload is high and salary not often reflective of this",
    "The management is suffocating and there is no real care for the wellbeing of employees. Some departments are clearly overloaded with work but instead time and money is spent doing days of colouring in and attending courses that you'll never use in your employment. The company exploits students for free labour quite consistently with very little wellbeing support in place. It drains you as a person, I wouldn't go back if it was the last place on earth.",
    "- Toxic environment with little support from the School\r\n- Few non-white and/or females in academic positions \r\n- Some academics exploit their PhD and Post-Doc researchers",
    "None that are worth mentioning.",
    "It is not a good choice for research and work since the environment and academic staffs are all not very excellent"

The small Amount he owed tripled because of the Atty fees for suing him. Previous to leaving I reported some serious issues around management behavior and nothing was done so I told the director who said that I was not the first person who reported those behaviors to them on all the people I mentioned  and they will take a look but that \" they have to trust their management\" and that nothing they can do to reverse that decision or take a closer look. Many of my former colleagues are astonished by the lack of desire to retain talent. So many great people have been let go and the new kids play video games and gamble online while the experienced do all the work and management locks themselves into offices and do not know anything at all about what you're doing in role. When you email them updates they deny they ever saw them in evaluations and blame you for them not knowing anything about what their employees are working on as far as special projects. Also, I am a man but I know women who've told me their salaries are well below mine, yet they have many more years of experience in the job than I did so they do not pay women equally. . Also, they take you away from your work to force you to present on useless topics just so they can say they did something on their performance evaluations. During these mandatory presentations my manager took personal phone calls on cell phone. One colleague told me that when they refused a promotion that they interviewed for because the salary was too low she said her manager threatened that she would not let her be promoted for at least one year from that time to punish her for making them do extra work by interviewing but not taking the job.

They had a ranking-style \"bucket\" review system that meant that someone always had to be put in the \"bottom bucket\", an awkward situation for any manager. My team and I found that our manager preferred to put his out-of-towners in those bottom buckets, and it was harder for us to defend ourselves against this action from afar. We had to push to be invited to visit Bellevue or Redmond, and our requests were often delayed or denied, so it seemed like we were held in remote reserve for the convenience of being put in the bottom bucket. We felt like orphans, to be sure. Our boss generally did not like working with remote employees, and we could not have been more aware of that fact.

    "I have worked at Microsoft for many years, first as an FTE then as a contractor (v-) so I have seen both sides of the coin.\r\n\r\nMiddle management is made up almost entirely of engineers instead of managers.  While it can be nice to have managers understand the technical aspects of a project, very few good engineers go on to become good managers.  Unfortunately, Microsoft almost never puts managers back into an individual contributor role unless the person specifically requests it, meaning bad managers get shuffled around leaving discontent in their wake.\r\n\r\nWork-life balance can be seriously out of whack in some groups.  This goes beyond the normal crunch-time chaos; multiple projects + hardware development builds every 4-8 weeks can easily lead to 6-12 months of 60+ hr weeks.  Expectations for FTEs are always increasing, making it that much harder to maintain a work-life balance.  Whatever you did to go \"above and beyond\" in the last review period becomes the minimum bar for the next review.  \r\n\r\nThe review system fosters a competitive, rather than collaborative, environment.  There is little incentive to help peers succeed as each person is stack ranked relative to the others in the group as \"assists\" aren't tracked or measured.  If something goes wrong everyone scrambles to find somebody to blame instead of figuring out what happened and pull together to fix it.\r\n\r\nWith the economic downturn, MS cut contractor pay by 10-20% across the board.  At the same time, most groups have limited contractors to 40 hrs/wk, putting lots of people under financial stress.  Some managers are expecting their hourly contractors to put in an extra 10-20 hrs/wk, unpaid, to get the job done.

During a 40 hour period, I had to do 60 hours week before and 60 hours week after a 1-week vacation to stay caught up, and still had to use my vacation days.  Can't trade OT for time off.\r\n- Depending on manager, feedback on performance may be good (early, actionable) or bad (too late, in-actionable).\r\n- Mid-to-upper management is all about coming up with fancy-sounding ideas and initiatives full of buzzwords that everyone else is forced to follow, but in reality these \"initiatives\" tend to be poorly thought-out, huge time wasters, and are obviously only there to pad management's commitments so they get good reviews and bonuses\r\n- Lots of office politics.  In many cases, advancement/bonuses/etc. are all about \"looking good\" to the right people, not actually being good at your job\r\n- Constantly pushing good ICs to become mediocre managers instead of letting them become *great* ICs.  This results in ICs that are great at knowing one tech / area / etc. being forced to own multiple areas at a much lower level of fluency and be less effective.\r\n- Microsoft as a whole feels relatively clueless about making new products that customers actually want.  Windows Phone is just one example of how Microsoft can totally shoot themselves in the foot, Skype hasn't had a major update in years and is losing ground to fast-moving newcomers, etc.  Depending on what you work on, there's a chance that it simply won't matter or exist in the next few years, which is frustrating.",

  "pros": [
    "Good discounts and other benefits and friendly staff members",
    "Other team-members are lovely, good staff discount",
    "The people you work with on a daily basis are lovely and it’s feels like a family",
    "You get to meet some cool people and interesting brand reps",
    "Great discount and members of staff will really help you because management often disappear leaving you alone, good place to add to your CV if you want to work in luxury retail",
    "Friendly company that is still small at heart",
    "Good discount and staff are nice",
    "Staff discount is pretty pointless as things still aren't affordable. No other pros worth mentioning other than occasional celeb spotting.",
    "Great discounts across and outside the store; good for entry level and there is opportunity to progress; Currently HN provides training for employees in London called 'Style Academy'. Very demanding in terms of providing an outstanding customer service which is measured by the Mystery Shopper report (with £100 voucher price when 100% achieved). Employees receive a lot of training and their salary is reviewed annually.",
    "Having worked here for 10 years I have had the opportunity to work with some wonderful people. Harvey Nichols is a fast paced environment to work in with things constantly changing.",
    "Good Perks for all their staff",
    "Higher quality restaurant with everything clean, staff meal always really good, friendly staff, chill attitude, and service charge added to salary made pay really good for the Hospitality industry"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Stressful, more work than youre paid for",
    "Little to no training given most staff get trained by other staff members, management can be very rude and unhelpful, general unhappiness seems to be a theme within store and little to no progression with the company even if you have been there a over a year",
    "Managed terribly!!!\r\nNo cross communication with managers \r\nTeamwork is not a thing \r\nPressure for targets makes every week shark week",
    "The disconnect between head office and OXO is quite bad. \r\nThe tone of communication always misses the mark and shows the directors don’t understand the average worker.",
    "Head office is far out in Chiswick\r\nFashion direction could be better",
    "Boring work - not given much to do as had to always look availabale to help customers. Pretty sleazy environment to work in.",
    "Minimum wage and no commission unless unrealistic targets are hit, managers expect you to work incredibly hard and sometimes even come in on days off unpaid for minimum wage, no one to speak to if you don’t agree with something as there’s no union, senior managers raise targets two days before the end of the month or cut off commission half way through the month, they pretty much get away with doing whatever that want and there isn’t anything employees can do about it, very inflexible, no shift swaps or day off requests are allowed, no chance of getting anywhere in this company unless you’re willing to be a snake in the grass to climb the ladder",
    "The re-location of Head Office to Chiswick has been a challenge to me personally as it has doubled my daily commute.",
    "A bit behind their competitiors",
    "Low wages doesn't correspond with workload - HN staff have much more responsibilities than concession staff (who usually earns more and have better commission scheme). Very strict when it comes to attendance, even a minute lateness can lead to intimidating meeting with a manager and a note in your record. Very demanding working hours (extended hours during Christmas or expectation to work 12h shift during special events). Old equipment makes it challenging to provide a good customer experience - the till can shut down in the middle of transaction or the phone will not work etc. the store can be extremely quiet and thus makes your job a bit boring, and the management will make sure that you don't spend quiet days chatting to colleagues (if you know what I mean).",
    "Super long hours like 9am-9pm always on your feet. Rude and upity customers who can be so demanding.",
    "The pay wasn't that good"

    "cut throat, misses the point",
    "Chance of starting a practice here are very slim.   Most people who successfully complete the training program are brought into an existing team and fed business.  Most other trainees are just a way for experienced brokers to be fed business after they fail out.  You are given no direction and are just a number on your managers spreadsheet.  Production hurdles if you finish the training program are unrealistic and pay drops as low as 20% if you don't hit production goals.",

    "long hours, aggressive traders can be hard to deal with",

    "Challenging environment, questionable management styles.",

    "Potentially long hours.  Many people in application pool (particularly in New York), which makes it that much harder in landing new positions, promotions, etc.  Make sure to do things to make yourself stand out if your interested in climbing the corporate ladder.",
    "Somewhat not friendly work environment",
    "too many systems to work with-consolidation will reduce a lot of cost, sometimes talent overlooked by management.",

Very little structure led to lots of wasted time, boredom, and late night cold calling. \r\n\r\nThe pay grid discourages mid-senior level advisors transfer AUM to new hires because MS pays new hires a higher grid rate.  It's part of the program. In your first year, you get paid a higher rate than your third year.  That's right. You initially make more in base pay + rate of commission, compared to, say fifth year.  It's a downward pay rate slope.  Because it's understood that you should have a larger AUM as time goes on. It's designed to pay upfront in first year, then decreases significantly.  By the end of the third year, you're expected to live off AUM entirely. But the capital raising goals don't stop after you graduate the program. And they will cut your pay grid to about 35% after you hit a certain AUM.",

Nothing against busy work--I completely understand that part of being an intern is paying your dues and doing the tedious work that others don't want to do--but it felt like this particular busy work wasn't even work that needed to be done. i.e. my supervisor asked me to spend a day reorganizing our client management system despite the fact that they were planning on changing over to a completely new enterprise software system later that month.",

    "Promotions are incredibly difficult and take ages to get\r\nPay has dropped well behind industry norms\r\nSome processes have become needlessly bureaucratic and slow",
    "Cisco has matured over the years but it no longer has that exciting \"start-up\" feeling. Traditional career paths for engineers don't exist any more. It is so much harder for individual contributors to be in control of  their career development, even  if HR says we have.",
    "Just the usual challenges with any large scale organisation, ranging from communication and information overload.  All of the management team are easily accessible so you can easily go to the top if you have any queries"

    "Truly a 1A culture and that comes from the top. The ability to collaborate with colleagues, on a global scale if needed, continues to amaze me. Work/life balance is second to none.",
    "amazing people and culture.\r\nnice environment",
    "Positive environment, lots in inter and intra team collaboration, constant opportunities to learn.",
    "Great perks, salary, benefits.\r\nEasy to relocate to the US.\r\nProvides a lot of learning opportunities.",
    "Amazing company - free food",
    "It is a great company. There are a lot of house-brewed open source technology for you to learn. Almost everything you use here is cutting edge so that you can probably work for many others after leaving here.\r\nI like that the company is under staffed so that the employees here can choose the big projects and make great contributions.\r\nAlso the company values relationship between each other so you will feel very respected by your peers.",
    "Incredible product, great place to work overall. It is really fun and they get creative in ways to motivate you.",
    "Inspiring and transparent senior leadership.\r\nGreat benefits, unlimited vacation policy and InDays every month to pursue our passions.\r\nWork culture and values that are at the core of our everyday business and lifestyle.",
    "Truly transformative culture transforming the lives of others, enabling transformation at so many of our clients and transforming the trajectory of so many careers of my colleagues and myself.  Every employee encouraged to participate in LinkedIn For Good making significant contributions to the communities we live and work in.  Every month there we have an InDay focused on personal improvement and our culture",
    "People, People and People. Benefits.",
    "Great colleagues; strong mission; powerful products",
    "As far as the corporate world goes, I cannot imagine a better work environment. Smart, passionate people, but without the arrogance and entitlement that exists at some other high-profile Silicon Valley companies. The example is set all the way from the top. Jeff Weiner is a world-class leader and is truly leading the way for the future of corporate leadership. 20th century models are no longer relevant. Instead, he preaches \"managing with compassion\" and \"conscious business,\" blending Western business pragmatism with Eastern philosophy. If you want to come to work inspired, this is the place.",
    "Empowered to take intelligent risks, all with the strong support of leadership. People are awesome, perks are unbelievable (esp. with new vacation policy... i.e. 2 weeks of shutdown and unlimited vacation). I feel very challenged, but very supported, which is a great place to be.",
    "Wonderful team with lots of career support",
    "The opportunity in front of LinkedIn is phenomenal, and to be a part of that is a wonderful feeling. We have experienced tremendous growth and change in the last few years and yet we are only just scratching the surface of the business and professional challenges that LinkedIn can help with.",
    "Great culture, products to sell, management is awesome",
    "Good culture, good work life balance",
    "great environment with great leadership",
    "Very good problems to work on, benefits",
    "- Fantastic Benefits (matching 401k, comprehensive health/dental/vision, Crossover Health partnership so you can easily make your appointments, $2000 \"Perk Up\" benefit to be used on child care, pet care, gym, or massages)\r\n- Workplace Perks (onsite coffee bar, multiple cafeterias, amazing chefs, gym + exercise classes, great facilities, snacks/drinks/fruit/etc) \r\n- Commuter Benefits (free CalTrain pass, shuttles) \r\n- Flexible work schedule -- a lot of managers do not sit in your office (obviously, depends on the organization you are in) so they are flexible about WFH as long as you are performing your job\r\n- Salary is decent (not the most competitive or the highest.... but it's offset by all the perks you get from the company)",
    "- so many great employee benefits and perks \r\n- still so much work to do on D and I, even though it’s talked about a lot",

  "cons": [
    "new strategy and recent decision",
    "Like any company, you have to learn how the game of office politics is played and LinkedIn is no different. Although, it is very tame compared to all other companies I have worked for",
    "Prioritization is an issue (too many things to do) and work life balance.",
    "Heavily dependant on US teams for projects.",
    "We are a fast growing company and sometimes we don't get things exactly right. Things that you might expect as a given get addressed a bit later than you would have wanted, as some parts of the business race to catch up with other parts.",
    "There are really none that I can think of.",
    "Becoming structured as we scale and hire quickly. So it's more difficult to advance upwards than it was previously. Lots of systems yet need to be revised and be made more efficient.",
    "That more professionals aren't able to experience a workplace such as this at least once in their career in order to help build this type of culture in so many other organizations.",
    "-Not enough support for remote employees. They look down on remote workers. We realize we are lucky to be granted the \"right\" to work remote but we are your top performers, maybe we should be treated like it. As you grow and your family grows you should be able to work remote and be supported the best way possible. \r\n-Raising quota's so high that a majority cannot hit will cause you to lose alot of employees over the next 3-6 months. You change quotas to be higher but you can also lower the quotas when you realize something is off.",
    "Not many that I can think of.",
    "Not everybody is a rock star and sometimes the best ones have to do a lot.",
    "Lots of fun activities that can distract from work",
    "Very little. Colleagues' Virtue signalling can become a little exhausting.",
    "- Moving to a much slower pace of getting things done post MS acquisition \r\n- As you progress in leadership, progression becomes more a relationship driven promotion pathway rather than core competency to do the role",
    "Not that I can see",
    "Due to rapid growth employees can be stretched a bit far at times, and not all processes are fully developed.",
    "Large company comes with bureaucracy",
    "- For a company that is in the talent business - helping people find jobs -we are really bad about internal movement to different organizations/roles. It's extremely difficult, and there is no bias towards internal candidates. They essentially want someone who already has done the job vs looking at transferable skills and keeping talent at LinkedIn. It's a real bummer, as this is a key reason why great talent have left LinkedIn to pursue their dream job at competitor companies that were willing to \"take a chance\" on them.\r\n- A lot of \"high performers\"/\"high achievers\" have left the company, so the leftover employees are mostly there just to do their job and go home. Not that this is necessarily a CON - but just something to point out. If you are looking to really learn and grow - fast - this is not the place for you. Most folks are here to do their job, do it well, and then leave. \r\n- Microsoft acquisition is slowly starting to creep in....",
    "Growth might be limited in some teams, and some bigger teams seem to have \"pride\" over others. Pay are not equalized between these teams.",
    "no career progression  outside of the US and Dublin; very poor mid management; clear favoritism from management; salaries not competitive for a tech company",
    "Hard to think of cons but commuting down to South Bay obviously isn’t ideal. The company attempts to mitigate this by splitting up the week.",
    "Nothing at all to be honest",
    "We tend to \"level down\". At another company my title would be Director, or at least SMR, but here I'm a manager. This makes no sense to me from a recruiting perspective, and somewhat undermines credibility externally in my role."

    "- Smart, hardworking people\r\n- Great internal tools and tech\r\n- You get a lot of freedom as an employee, and your ideas are valued by your manager and your peers if they are good.\r\n- Great perks\r\n  - Free food - Great cafeteria and decent selection of snacks and drinks at the micro-kitchen, plus two bars :)\r\n  - Decent gym allowance",
    "it is so damn great",
    "There is great teams and leadership",
    "* Lot's of hard challenges to solve and opportunities to grow\r\n* Flexibility in changing teams and roles\r\n* Fast-pacing environment\r\n* Strong colleagues, lot's of opportunities to learn\r\n* Great autonomy\r\n* Great support from the team and manager",
    "I am in Facebook less than a year, but I already love this company. So many internal tools. So much support from more experienced engineer. I can feel that my knowledge is growing every single day.",
    "Open, friendly, challenging environment. It's hard to believe that a company this big still genuinely feels like a startup but it truly does. The leadership works hard to remove obstacles to people doing their best work, and creating a culture where individual opinions are valued to drive innovation. You are encouraged to move fast and it's okay to fail if you're trying to push the limits and do something new (as long as it's back up with data/metrics/etc.). People are genuinely nice, collaborative, and so smart that you're constantly in a state of learning. London office has people from over 50 countries so great chance to meet some of the smartest people from around the world.",
    "- Flexibility in the technology stack, facebook has almost everything you would think of from Haskell, C++, to Java\r\n- Open and transparent culture, *almost* no secrets, all employees are treated as a trusted team"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "- No work life balance. To be fair, a fair number of people at FB work 40 hour weeks and are pretty successful, but it's not uncommon for people to work 10 hours a day or more, or work on a weekend because they are overloaded with work to do. A lot of people (including me) don't have any friends outside of work.\r\n- The whole \"We're changing the world\" thing starts to get old after a while.",
    "unfortunately there is not any",
    "there is too much travel involved",
    "* Processes are the mess, non-existent\r\n* Hacker culture is sometimes too much\r\n* Non-existent documentation\r\n* Engineering tools are mess",
    "Work/life balance is a challenge but something able to be managed with communication and support from your manager. As with any global company (especially one in such a period of rapid growth), there are growing pains around how to communicate locally vs. globally. London does hugely important work, building and shipping their own products. However Headquarters still think in a very US-centric way, this is something we're all working on.",
    "Hm, the only disadvantage I can see is that there is no disadvantages so far :(",
    "Sometimes you become so addicted to the internal tools that you rely on them and forget how the outside world works without them"

There will be occasions, during a busy time you will work until 4am and then be expected to show up at 9am the next day. After being on about 20 different clients this is what most teams expect (very very few exceptions).\r\n2. Pressure - If you cant handle the heat get out of the kitchen. The nature of the beast, but be expected to get assignments at 9pm due that same night and constant fire drills. I should have noticed the signs of my high blood pressure and anxiety way before it got too out of control. \r\n3. Management does not care about you - Again nature of the beast. Management answers to their manager above them, so they are under pressure and you are the pawn that will do all the work no matter the hours, no matter the stress. They pretend to care, but don't be fooled, they don't care, they are only pretending to do so in order for you to take on the large amount of work for them.\r\n4. Work life balance - none\r\n\r\nOverall... Churn and Burn. You work here until you are physically ill from exhaustion, stress, or other physically or mental ailments. But if you can take it, good for you! You are brainwashed to think this is the way work/life has to be. But, there is a whole other happier world out there. No benefits, compensation, exposure, or resume booster is worth the pain corporate life dishes out. Unless you like that stuff, then go for it!",

    "Great atmosphere, people are excellent and fun to be with. I really enjoy working with people with the advanced technology that we have.  Great location as well in New York, around all the best places to eat for lunch and dinner if you stay in the office late once or twice.  Management is strong and the direction of the company can been viewed with confidence.  Respect is also valued a lot and they do not mistreat people there.  Some of the friendships I built at Barclays I will keep for the rest of my life, so keep a watch on this company!",
    "Positive work environment, Good benefits and competitive pay for the region.",
    "Good benefits, good career opportunities in the larger cities",
    "Lively, collaborative, techy, great working conditions, well looked after, flexible working, good benefits package, decent salary, chance to progress, opportunities to learn and develop",
    "great company to work for if you want to retire there",
    "Good work life balance, good package",
    "Ability to telecommute, management very easy to work (depends on your team)",
    "Company is good for personal growth as it provides opportunities for career enhancement, tries to retain talent and pays competitive salaries as compared to its peers like Nomura RBS, etc., but not a pay-master.",
    "The paid me on time and sometimes early if it was a weekend but the staff incentives for having accounts had been lowered over the years.",
    "- Fantastic work-life balance.\r\n- Very competitive salary package.\r\n- Up to date technologies.\r\n- Good benefits.\r\n- Culture.",
    "Great company, and people. Many benefits that not all staff use including many corperate discounts.",
    "Used to be a good place to work with smart people, although it went nose down after the libor news",
    "staff were friendly in general",
    "Flexibility and good work life balance",
    "Great Intern Program. 10 weeks of a well constructed program. They encourage you to meet directors and managing directors - which is a great idea - and the directors seem to be quite used to the idea by now and sometimes take the interns out to lunch",
    "It really depends on the team and project you are on. I started on a fantastic project with a lot of great people which over time turned into a disaster which made about 10 people leave. We haven\"t had a single hire or a promotion in over two years. It happens regularly that we have simply no work to be done and we bring our personal laptops to work and work on our own pet projects to keep ourselves busy. \r\n\r\nThere is also virtually zero communication from upper management. Even though we are constantly told Prague is a key location for Barclays, it certainly doesn't feel that way. What is even more sad is that with no promotions over the last year we now have 3 open positions for more senior roles which could easily be filled from within, some of my colleagues have been with the company for 4 years. \r\n\r\nAlso the raise & compensation this year was ridiculous. The (public) year results say \"we made more money, but the compensation pool for employees is smaller\" on the same page that also says \"aligning compensations with results\".  This just leaves me speechless.",
    "- Good Culture\r\n- A lot of learning opportunities",

    "sales focused as with any other bank",
    "The work environment a bit tense",
    "Like all call centers, Barclays worships The Numbers. That is to be expected. \r\n\r\nHere is the REAL wrench in the engine...The computer systems get an \"upgrade\" (aka they CRASH) several times a month, often for several hours at a time! This  impacts employee performance and customer satisfaction to an unacceptable degree for a company with a pedigree like Barclays.",
    "Management has a hard time giving time off for people.  Snide comments are sometime present.  It is helpful to be nice and build relationships - the environment really fosters that.",
    "Starting salaries can be pretty low. On an average, the pool of employees is less talented in comparison to Deutsche, Goldman.",
    "Work life balance\r\nReward scheme not favorable to low staff",

    "Bullying and harassment are daily fare. \r\nSalaries are at the low end of the market. long hours are expected and extra efforts are quickly forgotten.\r\nRaising the point that the workload is unreasonable and leads to long hours meets a 'work smarter not harder'.\r\nI experienced first hand bullying and harassment and know of two other former colleagues having been  treated the same way without HR or upper management moving a finger.\r\nI raised a case with HR before resigning and it was only met by denial.\r\nNot a collaborative environment, a lot of back stabbing and politics. \r\nBrown nosing gets you farther than talent.",

    "Major con are the salaries. I wish 18k was enough for me to live. Job can be monotonous. Obviously a lot of politics that can deter you from advancing your career. Job freeze thaf did not allow for progression within the company. Bonus really hard to get as there are not a lot of opportunities to actually earn it (going above and beyond etc)\r\nBit strict on hours",

Change management skills and reporting are essential to be understood and implemented, and I have also learnt this over the years, and very capable of implementing on projects.",
    "Nice people to work with, some computers worked and chairs to sit on and a window to look out of the office.",

  "cons": [
    "Management are awful.",
    "With Babcock being a huge company, it can be difficult to get anything completed that falls outside of any process/procedures, which can be frustrating to solve. \r\nAnother downside of working for Babcock Marine can be the necessity to travel to other sites, which can become tedious with sitting in traffic! However, you’ll never be put out of pocket for these journeys and it is good to see the different business units.",
    "Rubbish pay, no career structure, management are hopeless and leaderless.",
    "There are no real cons, except for working with people who do not understand the workings of planning on projects, where there is no time to continually explain the meaning of the out come of progress and earned value reports, very frustrating.",
    "The company misses opportunities. Unfortunately, if you become unwell through work, you will not be fully supported. Full employee benefits will not be presented at joining. There are some time sensitive benefits.",
    "Management is poor and not effective. Do not take advice from people who deal with these issues day in day out. HR not helpful at all and no support give.",
    "No Overtime, no R&D, limited training opportunities, Poor long term work prospects",
    "Communication could be better, only in certain areas though.",
    "Limited technical work, At the end of the graduate scheme the pay is bad if you go for a skilled role. They will keep you capped on the Graduate pay scheme. Bit of a grad hating culture particularly from older members of staff and industrials. Some placements are pointless the term 'gradmin' has been used a lot for the pointless paper pushing that is assigned by some managers",
    "There are no cons",
    "Blame culture, poor management support. Lack of forward planning and panic measures to poor performance.",
    "Diversity within the employee groups needs to be improved."

I don't know whether this was because I only worked Saturdays or because there was no time or anyone available to train me. This left me feeling incompetent and unconfident in what I was doing\r\n- I never received a discount card, despite asking many times during my year and a half employment there.\r\n- Management was constantly changing, and line managers kept swapping departments, making it hard to raise issues and get them sorted (such as training and holidays)\r\n- When managers changed, new managers were not informed on the training given to staff, so would ask me to perform tasks that I had no idea how to do; when I then asked for help, I was treated like an inconvenience and a bad employee for not knowing how to do something I wasn't trained to do\r\n- Holidays were not very easy to get, management kept forgetting to put them on the system or tell me if I could have the day off\r\n- Weekend part time staff were made to clean the floors and empty the bins from the entire week; this was really degrading when other staff would look down on you and laugh as you were carrying 4-5 overflowing bins through the store\r\n-Operations team were made to clean up after other departments mess, and other departments were allowed to get away with improper disposal of waste, incorrect storage of items in the stock room\r\n- At delivery time, all managers disappeared and left only two people to pull in delivery ( we were told there must be minimum 3 at all time)\r\n- If one of the delivery staff was ill, no replacement was given and was expected to pull in delivery on our own; something extremely difficult when Saturday delivery is minimum 18 dollies.\r\n- Management was very unsupportive; no gratitude was ever shown from certain managers, and instead they would just give you the next thing to do, which after a long period of time makes you hate your job\r\n- Some managers gossiped about the part-time staff, particularly when they discovered you were leaving, making the working environment very unpleasant.\r\n- When you told a manager that you did not have the training/ did not know how to do a particular task, you were greeted with annoyance and made to feel like an inconvenience- hardly was I ever then shown how to do that task\r\n- Rota's were scarcely provided, and so staff, and most managers, had no idea who was meant to be working that day\r\n- Managers were far too busy trying to meet targets, and so had no time for staff queries\r\n-Weekend only staff were treated like outsiders by management",

    "DHL offers a lot of opportunities and a very supportive framework from the upper management for anyone to prosper.  It is one of the largest companies in the world and so smaller regional teams tend to form tight-knit relations to work together and flourish. We do frequent potlucks, host once a month employee appreciation day when we get to eat cakes and ice creams.  We host carnival themed games, go out to lunch with various teams, participate in biking, running and walking competitions.  We host international food festival. We raise money for charities by doing various fun activities.  Management allows flexible work hours.  Senior management really cares about retaining talents, they research, regularly discuss about how to make the work environment better, how to grow talents internally, who we can promote, who can/would succeed who and adjust salaries, if needed.  CEOs, CIOs and VPs are very approachable and down-to-earth.  They will smile, say hi to you and talk.  We interact with our coworkers from various regions and learn about their cultures and their ways of doing things.  Some of them can be very educational and interesting.  Cubes are bigger than all the places I have worked at.  We have foosball, pool table and putt putt."

    "Poor communication throughout the business. Removes responsibility from it's staff and therefore encourages lots of GLL robots that are unable to think for themselves. A lack of responsibility has resulted in lots of staff not taking accountability or caring about their role. Lack of creativity in its day-to-day working. Low wages, lack of career progression, extremely old fashioned management. GLL venues mimic their management; boring, lack of energy and innovation, all the same and budget.",

  "cons": [
    "Working hours are longer than average and pay doesn't reflect this. Company policy includes the right to apply for flexible working, so if you're a long distance commuter you can apply to work from home occasionally. However lower and mid level management will put guilt trips on you and treat you like a child and try to stop remote working because they have trust issues. Plenty of passive aggressive victimisation from management. Some managers don't even do anything all day and when requested to actually do something they haven't got a clue what they're meant to be doing! Some managers don't even know what your work entails. Therefore you can't hope to get any support from them. Expectations to suddenly drop your life and sleep and work all evening/night for the simple fact they've promised the earth to the client without realising how much actual work is involved. Reluctance to send work to India because they're no good, therefore putting tremendous pressure on the poor person doing the work. No wonder staff sickness levels due to stress are high! No measures put in place when the staff members return from being signed off with stress. Just more continued passive aggressive bullying and management incompetence. The company has a habit of whisking away your account and making you train someone else to do your job. You then get shoehorned into another role with insufficient training, whether it matches your skill set or not, which causes stress and resentment.  High turnover of staff resulting in knowledge disappearing causing problems to the remaining staff who have to pick up the pieces and deal with managers who have a massive chip on their shoulder. Some managers are simply waiting for a high redundancy payout and resent having to be in the office, so they don't actually do any managing. Few staff incentives and rewards. Bad internal systems which are not fit for purpose. IT support is an absolute joke.",

For account management, they are at high risk of being unemployed if you are intending to stay in the company long and moving to another job in the future.",
    "Upper management has no idea what goes on at the site level.  They show up once every so often and don't seem to realize they're in the clients space and they simply aren't as important as they think they are.. Again all that matters is the relationship you build with the client",

    "- Low compensations for low-level employees (although their hours are significantly better than typical NYC agencies)\r\n- Freedom and flexibility can lead to chaos for some",
    "Working for this company over the past decade has often felt like rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. Core problems are that years of cuts to compensation, benefits and training -- as well as directionless upper management -- has resulted in many (most?) of our accounts being staffed by a workforce that is low on morale and the skills needed to get the job done. Last year's sale to Advent seems to have made little difference. Although, we did receive marginally better \"merit increases\" this past year (which may be coincidence). Management is aware of the morale problem and other similar challenges, but typically seems more interested in talking or marketing their way out of them, rather than truly investing in their people. It has been sad to see my company stagnate like this. I myself used to feel like my account team was among the best in the business. However, it's becoming increasingly clear that other competitors out there have grown far more skilled and innovative. That said, most of our clients continue to cost-control obsessively; so they are sticking with us for the time being, as WLT still manages to offer a compelling value proposition, in relation to cost.",
    "It's not a great working environment. Layoffs in the former Tag area of the business have made things very difficult, increasing workload for the remaining few.",
    "I was hired in a Senior Level Client Manager position.\r\nUpper management was non-existent.\r\nMiddle management was a tight group of brit boys and pals who managed very little and just kept things on track with very little change in status quo.\r\nThe heavy lifting was done by younger employees, underpaid, undervalued and under appreciated.\r\nI would not recommend Tag.",
    "Working remotely can be frustrating at times, so a team meet-up once a year would be great.",
    "Some Middle level managers are the problem",
    "I intended to give a two-weeks notice before my departure but found myself leaving without much more than a formal, unplanned resignation. I'm happy to relay my sentiments here and would also like to note that this 'review' will find itself posted on public job review sites to better help future potential employees have a thorough understanding of what working for Williams Lea Tag is like.\r\n\r\nIt is as follows:\r\n\r\nI could not and would not subject any self-respecting individual to being employed for a company with such poor regard for basic, fundamental morality in the workplace. During my time with WLT, I have either witnessed or have personally experienced racism, sexism, physical harassment, verbal harassment, stalking, death threats and a general air of absolute hypocrisy from management (both on-site and above) that no company should condone. \r\n\r\nIt is hilarious in only the most sardonic ways that a manager-- one who has little regard for anything remotely related to professionalism-- can repeatedly allow situations such as drinking on the job, blatant displays of aggression (both to/at property and fellow employees), and sexual/derogatory remarks to occur and yet believe himself fully justified in cherry picking which employees will be held accountable for minor infractions such as cell phone usage, arriving late due to city commute, and the personal use of work computers while also himself being guilty of each.\r\n\r\nThere is further hilarity in the fact that management and HR will resort to covering their own hides after putting their employees in danger and resort to backhanded punishment in order to place the fault of these dangers on the employee themself rather than their own lamentable lack of judgment. \r\n\r\nSo, no, I would not consider working for WLT again. I would never recommend this company to a friend. I would never recommend this company to an enemy. Before taking the job, I saw many disparaging reviews for the company and more specifically management, and I'm bereaved to discover that those complaints barely scratched the surface with this toxic environment. I hope-- sincerely-- that the fellow members of my team find new employment and move on to better opportunities that they are surely deserving of.",
    "Senior leadership focuses on wrong things and employees have to suffer through their mistakes. CEOs are not credible or likable - they recently stiffed a subordinate who won a weight loss challenge (they aren't cheap, just jerks)",

    "- Issues with diversity: when I worked there I had a colleague tell me I only got the job \"because I was brown\". I later had an apology from a manager however the issue wasn't ever addressed with the person who made the statement. They also had an issue of the staff magazine that actually said \"we like to hire ethnic minorities so that we know what they eat and we can sell it\" (that's not a  direct quote, but it was written to a similar standard). This same magazine said that they support LGBTQ because of the Pride festival. You might as well say that we hire diversity so we can use their heritage to make sales and we hire LGBTQ because they have parties. They're so insensitive when it comes to diversity. Further to this, the area in which I worked I experienced racism from the shoppers. I've been told basically \"go home\" and some people wouldn't come to my till and would rather queue. It REALLY has an  impact on your self-esteem.\r\n\r\n- The hours and pay they advertise for positions aren't what they say they are. They might put full time however they won't have those to give you. If you say you want those hours you're seen as \"inflexible\". They also advertise up to 9.91 on some job vacancies, however even some lower level managers won't get that pay. The pay is closer to £8.40 or £8.99 if you're a driver. \r\n\r\n- Communication is TERRIBLE. Having worked part time I decided to try and find some more hours somewhere else. A few years later I noticed they now had full time hours. I applied and was sent an invitation for a group interview with only 1 time slot available. I went into store and asked if there was anything else available and was told it \"wasn't PC\" to do this as it would be seen as too advantageous. I was due in Hospital, so really I thought it'd be better to ask rather than decline and seem disinterested. So in the end it was anything but advantageous. They did eventually put up some more dates for a group interview, but when I attended it was a one on one interview. I had to answer some questions and then do a test, and if I was successful I was told that I would have to do a driving test. I was then told I was unsuccessful. I also had an application in for another store at this point, and so I went to this interview and when I arrived I was told that a) the guy who interviewed me rang this other store to talk about me and b) that this interview (which I received emails about) was not on their books so I'd turned up for nothing. I was told later that this other store had put in an offer for me, however when I rang resourcing they told me that this didn't exist and that the interview should have taken place. They then spoke to the store who was supposed to ring me back and since then no-one has given me ANY information! All I can assume that the original store had an issue with (I wouldn't be surprised if this was to do with diversity) and rang this other store to somehow stop this interview going forward. When I received feedback from the original interview, it didn't even correlate to how the interview actually went and it didn't even include any information on the written assessment I was made to do. \r\n\r\n- Whilst I worked their they changed the whole \"free coffee\" thing so it was unavailable for staff on their working days .. NOT just during working hours, but the entire day. So if you'd worked 8 hours you couldn't do you shopping and get a free coffee, and then if you're working full time you could only do that 2 days a week on your days off.\r\n\r\n- One of the higher ups during my \"tenure\" made some terrible comments about trading with France. He wasn't disciplined, he just made some terrible excuse with a half hearted apology. Yet somehow people have been fired for making some small comment on Facebook! \r\n\r\n- The bonus is dwindling. It's so meagre now for employers that it barely means anything yet it's still touted as a perk. I mean that small percentage each year is fine if you're paid more .. a lot more.\r\n\r\n- They've removed their canteens now so all staff have are vending machines.\r\n\r\n- Booking holidays makes no sense. I was asked to book my holidays for the year all in one go at the start of their calendar year. Given that I can't account for what might happen in the year I found it near impossible, but you're made to do it by a certain time or they book it for you, and they will just squeeze it in where they see fit (even if it makes no sense).\r\n\r\n- If you write into their staff magazine and raise a complaint they will tend to come back to you with a \"we're sorry that you feel that we are wrong\" so they can avoid actually apologising whilst continuing to tell you that they are in fact right (which just reads like a terrible University letter).\r\n\r\n- The uniform is pretty damn uncomfortable. I'd advise to get your own trousers unless you like static shocks.\r\n\r\nHonestly, there is so much more I could list but this is on the verge of turning into a dissertation so I'll just leave it at that.",

    "Ever since the introduction of ‘Modern Waitrose’ and one branch rota I felt the tension and stress increase in store. Waitrose is losing money and action had to be taken. We were informed in a formal group meeting with a PowerPoint presentation conducted by a department manager. Although we did not know the full implications involved when it actually happened. I only worked one full day a week on Saturdays and I felt the pressure. Partners felt more stretched to cover more bases without seeing a real increase in pay. \r\n\r\nBefore the one branch rota was introduced a few months ago, sections had their own rota we could refer to with ease. We could clearly see what hours partners were working, who was on lunch, or on break, who is on holiday and who has phoned in sick. Annoyingly management would often steal cross trained partners from checkouts to help work on another section without informing us, which was often the case. Without the rota this caused chaos as we had to play guess work or ask a dozen of questions. There were many new young faces and often we did not know their surname to make a call out for them when it got busy. We were told not to conduct too many call outs as it created ‘noise’!! \r\n\r\nThe master copy of the one branch rota was difficult to reprint as we did not know it was saved on the system. The text was rather small to read in the full page chart. It took a while to make sense of it all and as there was only one branch rota on a clipboard it was difficult to locate in store. Management should have made more effort to print off a clearer copy for us to read. \r\n\r\nMany customers expect sufficient number of checkouts to be open and as my role as Checkout Supervisor my job was to reduce the queues. Often than not management would get annoyed at us for stealing shop floor partners who were checkout trained to open a checkout. Quite often shop floor cashiers would make errors at the checklist for example mis identifying fruit and vegetables on the screen and therefore overcharging the customer. Our aim is to provide excellent customer service it got to a point we were not delivering our promise due to the fact Checkouts were continually short staffed. We were not working as a one branch team. \r\n\r\nMany partners are unhappy with the changes implemented. Waitrose stopped Annual Review of Performance (ARP) with their line manager although I have been told it will be returning soon. If you are doing well you are not praised and you will soon know when you have done something wrong management will fall on you like a tonne of bricks. \r\n\r\nI had made the decision to leave as there was no variety in my role. Many tasks were repetitive. Management had shown no real interest in my personal development. I am very capable in learning new skills. A few members of management became unapproachable as you could see the amount of stress they are under. \r\n\r\nImage is a huge factor at Waitrose, management love young partners as they are seen to be more adaptable and enthusiastic than older partners. The young partners want the experience on their CV however are often tricked into given more responsibility but really you are paid a lower wage for more work load which is a huge advantage for Waitrose.",
    "When I had to work on counters, I felt we were badly understaffed compared to other areas in the store, eg. checkout, stock. As a consequence, those working on the counters often had to shoulder a huge workload while being asked to cover other areas at the same time. At times, there were some unreasonable customers too. Training was neglected too. The pay is good relative to other retail stores.",

    "There were quite a few times when I felt that we were understaffed and it put pressure on the rest of the staff to be able to retain the same level of customer service as normal.

    "Hierarchical and alot of red-tape decision-making",
    "Management needs to be streamlined",
    "A lack of career progression, poor management, running like a budget airline.",
    "The shifts are ridiculous. Starting a shift at 7,30am means that you have to wake up at 5am, leave the house at 6.30am, on a weekday the first bus leaves at 7am, so you may arrive at work ontime. On the weekends, no chance, you have to take a taxi which would be a minimum of £15. \r\n\r\nWhen you are sick or away from work for even a day, the attendance unit hound you like a pack of wolves. Sending emails, letters, repeatedly calling you everyday, speaking with your manager behind your back... it does get quite ridiculous.\r\n\r\nManagers/other colleagues enjoy it when other agents get budgets. Sometimes they proactively issue you with a budget with a smile on their face.\r\n\r\nThere are so many new people in the office. I look around and I don't know anyone there.\r\n\r\nIf you breathe too hard this will be recorded by your manage and fed back to you. The targets are so high that around 98% of the office are in a 'process' a process triggered by failing to hit targets. The funny thing is that when you do hit the targets - nothing happens.\r\n\r\nTeam leaders often walk away when you approach the duty desk, like they are scared of your query or just being generally evasive.",
    "The company really don’t care about you! It’s all cost cutting here, there and everywhere. They have dashboards which monitor your performance and it twines in with bonuses. It really effects morale as you can work as hard as possible yet the dashboard scores will be negative and have horrible comment and comments from cabins you didn’t work in.\r\n\r\nSickness is managed stringently. A lot of crew don’t go sick in fear of being places on a sickness level. \r\n\r\nThe pay is low and not worth it and conditions are deteriorating. Gone are the days when you had actual work space. On the new aircraft you have no workspace and it’s claustrophobic. On the Neos you have no workspace nor a place to eat. You eat next to a toilet. All so the company can squeeze in more seats.\r\n\r\nThere is a high turnover rate because BA has just gone to the dumps. Working at Ryanair is genuinely better than working at BA.",
    "If you're not a people person, it can become very stressful. Managers are great but the company overall doesn't care about there employees.",
    "Worn out, careless, militant crew. Not helpful at all, horrible welcome for new crew on board. Terrible managers."

When you ask for assistance, instead of just helping you, the first sentence you hear is, \" I've told you how\" ..... When you are brand new, this makes you feel like you don't belong.

  "cons": [
    "No appreciation from management for how much you do. Working here can be tough, especially during sale periods. You could work your hands to the bone through a late shift without as much as a thank you. Staff can be made to feel replaceable and this isn't a good relationship to have with a company.",
    "Management really made work unenjoyable- some managers made you feel very small and spoke to you like they were superior... they were just working in retail.\r\nYou had to wear the seasons clothes.. not everyone can afford to be spending money on clothes just to wear to work.\r\nTill area is very untidy- managers need to take control and tidy it, what needs to be kept where etc.\r\nSecurity staff were very rude to employee's... you almost felt like you were being accused of stealing from the store at times.\r\nFelt very clique-y at times and you thought middle aged women wouldn't be as intimidating",
    "Had to work 3 hours later than anticipated on my 18th birthday to get store ready for boxing day. Meant that i didn't see half my family.",
    "Some people have been in their jobs way too long and naturally stagnate. This creates talent log-jams with people not being able to progress and improve the business. 'Dead man's shoes' and 'who you know' drives many promotions which also causes long term issues. There is little in the way of flexible working; you need to be at your desk.",
    "Terrible, insincere atmosphere, supervisors will watch everything you do and report it back to management to use against you.",
    "Long working hours mostly unpredictable",
    "Not much career progression, managers that only care about achieving KPIs, low staff morale and doing little to motivate staff",
    "Minimum pay and long time on your feet",
    "Very boring at times so if you get bored easily its not a job for you",
    "small and not large enough yet to compete on a bigger scale",
    "low pay, less shifts, need for frequent breaks",
    "condescending managers, overtime is forced upon you, have to work every christmas, can't have holidays during sale periods",
    "Tiring doing tedious tasks for hours on end",
    "The only problem I see is the management don't always act on problems you report straight away. And I feel they are to lenient on problem employees who bend the rules",
    "Sale prep is not fun work",
    "Not valued, poor salary, too high expectations, under staffing, constant cuts across all areas, rubbish benefits, fear factor, people in higher positions think they are untouchable, unfair,",

    "unflexible hours and short breaks",

    "very unorganized\r\nlots of time on your feet",
    "Starting from wrong salary, mysterious absences that never happened, wrong hours, wrong tax calculation that you have to sort out yourself as payroll contact detail are unattainable for a non managerial type of employee. Managers often work in different buildings so there is no way of talking to them in person, hard to even call, the only way is to text or email. Booking holidays through your manager proves impossible and they often ignore you anyway. The company bombard your email with some junk and sales promotions. They employ more people that they have equipment or capacity for, so sometimes you end up waiting for equipment or assignment for hours. Some procedures are shockingly inefficient, you waste hours on something that could be actually done much much quicker with less mess.",
    "Company expect too much from you, management needs improved, training needs improved",
    "On late shifts they most of the time make you stay extra 15min to tidy up unpaid",

    "A great management team with the drive to improve the recruitment industry tenfold. Top training techniques and market knowledge to assist us in becoming the best of the best in our respective specialisms.",
    "Opportunities for growth in a growing organisation",
    "There aren't any apart from the day you leave.",
    "The people you work with and the managers make this a really enjoyably place to work. You're given responsibility for important tasks from an early stage, giving you the chance to progress and develop. A good work/life balance also helped.",
    "Clear opportunities for progression, it is recruitment, if you hit X targets you get X job title X pay increase, it is very clear what you need to do. Anyone that says there isn't opportunity to progress isn't performing well.\r\n\r\nSpeaking for my office, it wasn't a cut throat environment, management are very happy to do what they can to support consultants.\r\n\r\nGreat training including 3 days at Reed's business school, with follow up sessions and further coaching in branch\r\n\r\nFree tea / coffee, season ticket loans, incentives.",
    "There are some amazing people who work at reed, highly collaborative and it's innovative company to work for.",
    "support is always there when needed",
    "Great development plan for new starters, where they place you on an apprenticeship scheme as soon as you start, therefore you qualify in a CERP by the end of 13 months, which all falls inline with your job title."
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Not ideal for those who are not reselliant as you need to get to grips with negative feedback from the possible clients, or candidates fulfilling a role elsewhere.",
    "How long have you got?  Totally ungrateful, never once appreciated the fact that I was a qualified, proficient and experienced PA.  Oh they did buy me a kit Kat once.  Do they think I'm starving?  Probably on their wages.  Unrealistic pay, terrible jobs and filthy offices, incompetent staff, what more can I say?",
    "Salaries on offer might be better elsewhere, but remember to balance this against enjoying your job/life!",
    "End of the day recruitment isn't a great job if you aren't making placements. If you make placements it's great, you earn lots of commission, you get quick progression. If you aren't the business development can be tough and there is pressure to hit targets. This is the same for any recruitment company though, not just Reed. \r\n\r\nHours (depending on the comparison) Reed are much better than a lot of other recruitment companies, but it is longer hours than a standard 9-5. The commission does reward the extra effort though.",
    "No cons to share / report",
    "Senior Director level staff are so far away from the real life business world. We as a company are old school still",
    "Salary are way below industry standard",
    "No cons experienced in my time here"

    "Great for those who love art and antiques",
    "Inspiring atmosphere, interesting people, fast-paced",
    "Exciting, fast-paced environment working with many smart and talented people.",
    "I think there is a misconception about the atmosphere working here from an external point of view. I was told it was cold and unfriendly, but I found the total opposite when I arrived. Everyone is welcoming and happy to collaborate. It is true that some departments are more 'cliquey' than others, but that is just the nature of the art market in general.",
    "Undoubtedly, a super-cool place to work. You can tell that Sotheby's is at the apex of the Art World from the second you walk into the building.",
    "very intertsiing to handle art object"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "low paid but its ok",
    "Expect to work long hours (and weekends) for low pay.  Organization lacks the desire to develop young and dedicated staff or provide on-the-job training to those who express an interest.",
    "Department heads can be demanding",
    "longer hours when nearing events",
    "The salary is lower than you would expect for the same position in a different company/sector.",
    "Summer is a slow time in the art world, and this reflects on the work load for everyone at the company, especially the interns. Just an issue of timing."

    "The higher management have no clue how the postal system works and thus make stupid changes which never work and instead cause issues for both staff and customers. There is no real communication between any higher management and shop floor staff. There is always a staff vs management atmosphere at work where a manager will have been told they \"have\" to enforce some stupid change and the staff can't physically do it but none of them care once you have left the building with the post. Management often turn off phones and leave office early so if you do the job properly and finish to your time your screwed if you have a problem later on. The leaflet/ door to door system became a scam for employees and we don't get paid properly for the work load anymore. The whole way the company works right now is relying on workers coming in early off their own backs and using their own cars, if for just a few weeks everyone came in for their time and finishes on their time and sent bags out with drivers as it should be done then then whole place would fall apart.",
    "Too much pressure put on part time workers - they expect you to finish a full round within the 5 hour working day often sending you out on a round without showing you round the postal area first\r\nVery poor management structure - no support from senior manager's (Dom's) to the branch managers\r\nManagers arent properly trained and there is no concistency they get moved around very often from branch to branch \r\nUnruly staff poor working conditions due to poor management ive witnessed long service postmen telling managers what to do\r\nVery low morale amoungst staff especially long serving staff members\r\nPoorly serviced trolleys often the brakes dont work or the trolley doesnt lock properly \r\nHealth and safety at work is a joke if you have an accident at work your on your own\r\nGeneral standards have fallen dramatically uniforms not being worn often see staff in tracksuits or jeans or wearing trainers",
    "Boring, repetitive. bla bla bla need 5 words",
    "Bad culture at all levels.\r\nLack of development and opportunities.\r\nLack of clarity in strategy.\r\nSlow to respond to change. \r\nReliant on USO.",
    "A lot of inaccurate reporting and \"favours\" preventing the progression of the business. Need to have strong communication skills or you'll suffer",
    "Long hours. 15miles walking. Impossible workloads. \r\nTiring",

    "I always had to ask for a break.. many times I went 8 hours without one. Worked very hard with no respect and treated like crap by immature ADULTS. I was treated like a janitor (not just for the bathrooms, tables, floors, soda machine, and retched party room. At closing I was always expected to do everything which took forever cause it was a lot and the manager criticized me for taking too long because I actually took the time to clean it because I thought the place was disgusting. We all had to use rags which had food on them in the CLEAN bucket.(sometimes the water was completely brown) I told MANY MANAGERS (which there are always too many for no reason) and they just said people that use the grill put it in there so they wouldn’t waste rags or some stupid crap. So, I was told to wipe down tables AND TRAYS with nasty food covered rags. I finally told the regional manager how disgusting it was and he showed me A STRIP ON TOP OF THE BUCKET which said if it was sanitary or not I mean WTF a rag WITH FOOD ON IT THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN USED IS A DIRTY RAG. I will NEVER eat inside McDonald’s knowing what I know-(never wanted to anyway cause the place is always disgusting.) The issue with there being so many managers- one would tell me to do something like mop or clean windows etc..then another would come up to me and say “I told you you need to be at the register!” They’d go round and round all the time. It was utterly ridiculous constantly having to explain myself. I cannot do everything at once. But that’s how they treated me while every other manager simply got payed more to stand around, criticize everyone, and be immature. I was never trained much to begin with-I literally was trained by another employee (in like 30 minutes) because the manager told them to. I was constantly yelled at by customers that everything cost too much-then the manager would come up and say something like “if you just turned it into a MCCHICKEN AND REPLACED THE CHICKEN WITH A BURGER IT WOULD’VE COST LESS” How am I supposed to know that (or have much time to figure it out on my own-especially when there’s a line of crappy eating McDonaldheads all PO’d in line.) I’d rather die than work at McDonald’s ever again. You might as well be an actual waitress AND GET PAID MORE rather than be a waitress, a cashier, and a janitor all at once; be treated like crap and paid CRAP. If you want to be kind to yourself and keep your sanity, please never work at McDonald’s! \r\n\r\nP.S- the remake is terrible and poorly run",

The partners (for the most part), are great.  There will always be many that are not, but the partner culture is one of trust and investment.  This creates a strong, and sensitive leadership that will keep PwC on a leading list of employee satisfaction and prestige.",

    "People that would have been a super star in any other setting are viewed as average at PwC.  Everyone is competing against everyone else.  They literally send out a report every month to every individual in the Atlanta office showing everyone's utilization and hours worked without masking any names.  Everyone at PwC is an overachiever because you have to be an overachiever to be hired by PwC.  Being an overachiever is not a bad thing. The problem starts when you are judged versus people that have no problem working 14 hours a day 6 days a week.  Not every client is the same.  One client's information can be harder to sort and figure out than another client's financials.  Those people that are working 14 hours a day on an easier client can log extremely impressive hours while you're stuck working the same hours on a more difficult client and are forced to eat your hours so that you stay on budget which makes your utilization fall below the threshold.  Once you're placed on a client you are dealing with that client for many months at a time but because their information takes longer to figure out than what was budgeted, you end up on the bottom of the utilization sheet. Management doesn't really care even though the utilization rate is what your performance is judged on and what your compensation is usually based on. If a partner sells a project for a low fee and it ends up taking longer than budgeted for, you're screwed from the utilization stand point as an associate and no one really cares.  My breaking point was when I couldn't make it to a store before it closed at 9 pm for several weeks because I was stuck at work.  It can definitely feel cut throat all the while everyone is smiling and pretending that they're having a great day. Forcing these hours should be illegal.",

A prevailing myth is that you have the slow summer season to study, but that only worked during the mortgage boom. Now auditors are working year-round audit hours (i.e. 10+ hrs/day) because so many companies are tanking and you're expected to be pulling these long shifts as well as spend any minimal free time you have to study for a license that may or may not get you a promotion depending on how many manager butts you've kissed.\r\n\r\n(2) If you're too good of a worker, management likes to keep you on their teams. You may voice your opinions and desires on where you want your career to go, but basically if you're not a manager or above your opinions are not considered. They will shuck you wherever they want you and HR tells you to just suck it up. The only times I've seen it work in favor of an associate is if they have a manager coach that is willing to fight senior management for you. Of course the majority of them are too worried about their appearance in front of sr. mgrs and partners and would rather just give you the HR PC line \"Just keep fighting\".\r\n\r\n(3) Compensation after the first year is not on par with the level of work, responsibility and quality you're expected to provide the client and the company. You may be the best experienced associate worker, but that doesn't mean you'll get paid more than the slacker associate; it just means that management will give you more work than the other guy. Specifically, in 2005 PwC was handing out double digit pay raises around 20%. Associates then started at $49K; thus even if the employee was slacker he still made $58K by the time 2006 rolled around. Starting in 2006, the market started to slow down; new associates were starting at $51K, but because they were new they were thrown into the \"newbie\" bin and only got 8% raises. However, slacker joe still got a 10% raise. Thus the end of that year, you as the 2nd yr associate would make $55K, while the 3rd yr associate who wasn't pulling his weight made $63K. The new year rolls around and management sees that you're a much better worker than the 3rd year; they end up doling out to you all of the difficult assignments while slacker joe gets the easy ones as he's less likely to mess them up. You're busting your butt for a measly $55K (which, after tax, only translated to a $100 increase in your paycheck and was only about $50 higher than the new associate pay), whereas slacker joe gets to leave early and still make $200 more than you per paycheck. - This is a true scenario, not  a hypothetical situation. I'm not sure if they've fixed this now, but anyone who got hired in 2006 and 2007 got screwed  big time with wages and raises.",

The hoops one needs to jump through - whether to initiate a project, establish a teaming relationship, handle admin tasks, or address personal financial independence requirements - are off the charts.

Sons and daughters of politicians work here and behave as if they own the company bad-mouthing partners and treating subordinates as crap. After working in Bangalore and Delhi, PwC Calcutta was so much of a shock to me that I almost went into depression!!!\r\n\r\n2) Partners are God attitude is extremely annoying and highly inefficient. \r\n\r\n3) For the same position there is sometimes a huge difference in pay scale depending on how you negotiate and how badly they want you in.\r\n\r\n4) PwC Calcutta offices ofcoure are glorified BPOs and KPOs. The infrastructure and the kind of work mirrors the state of affairs in West Bengal - horrible.

Also, onsite work is too hectic and difficult to sustain with family (better to travel alone) \r\n5)Lot of speculative hiring and then new employee will be assigned to a project which is NOT A RIGHT FIT. A developer will be asked to do testing and automation tester will be asked to do manual testing and if you refuse you will be branded NOT FLEXIBLE.",

It is simply hypocritical.\r\nThe IM Board are lawyers, not business people, and it shows.  Their idea of what management is / does is to micro-manage, but without any clue themselves how to overcome issues, they start to attribute blame.  This has led to a Blame Culture, that we all talk about (often joke about).\r\nThe systems and operations are rubbish.  Its just not what IM care / think about.  None of the good Ops / IT Managers stay very long, presumably because they can't stand the working environment."

    "Long hours and low pay",
    "When busy, had to work triple shifts 3 days in a row, although this was a rare occurrence. During the slow season you would be lucky to work 3-4 shifts all week. Management of the hotel, in general, is god awful. No organization, poor leadership, always put the blame on everyone else but themselves. This location is a training hotel for a lot of management and directors, so the lack of experience definitely ties into what I mentioned above.",
    "I can't think of one.",
    "Not a performance driven culture",

    "Horrible hours, some rude management",
    "Management didn't know what they were doing and didn't seem to care about anyone but themselves. Many \"lower-level\" employees have been there higher than most of the managers.",
    "Hyatt house hotel in Redmond, was is the worst employer to work for. As I was hired as a part time for laundry attendant, I did told the supervisor, I had no experience whatsoever. In the end less then three days, and broken opportunity promise to train me as a house attendant, they sent out a letter that I was laid off, because no hours. It's ridiculously weird. I given my mother's number to be  contacted, but they played with words back and forth.Poorly manage and a very bad vibe, and unhealthy environment to be working at.

  "pros": [
    "If working in the fashion industry is a goal in your life, full/part time work in a clothing fashion stores like Topshop help boost your knowledge of the retail industry as well as helping reaching your goal if committed.",
    "Decent amount of holidays (if you book 3 months in advance or take them when they allocate)",
    "4 60% discounts every three months , friendships that you build .",
    "-6 Pieces of uniform every three months with 60% off\r\n-25% off staff card \r\n-Pension scheme\r\n\r\nTopshop is the best fashion retailer on the high street and I will always have this strongly in my mind; constantly challenging what can do better, selling fantastic products, and being one of the only retailers to have a show in LFW. \r\nGenerally the colleagues I work with are lovely, passionate and inspiring. \r\nI have managed to progress gaining trust and responsibility of my own department.\r\nThe environment/store i work in is very fast paced and I am always busy with tasks.\r\nMy managers encourage success personally and within sales plans.\r\nI have had a wide exposure to the company as I gained a 4-week head office placement for buying which I thoroughly enjoyed.",
    "I loved working with the other employers, environment was very welcoming",
    "Loved working with the people",
    "Great fashion and 60% off for uniform, that is about it!!!",
    "develops range of skills, team environment, fast trend movements, creative and styling",
    "Great discounts on clothes (60% off 4 items every quarter) (30% off on everything)\r\nSales Associates are fun to work with"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "They barely give you any hours to work, you make find yourself not scheduled to work for 2 weeks sometimes, management is not that great at all, 99% of your shifts will only be 4 hours long, because of low hours your paycheck is only enough to cover gas money for a week and a half, the stylists will steal credit for a customer that you styled, the amount of work that you must do for one shift does not equate to the pay all. I get more money from my parents than I do from working 3 days a week at this job.",
    "Pay is terrible as a VM, workplace health and safety is almost non existent, you are expected to do an exceptional amount of work while being paid the same as the floor staff, theres barely any internal advancement.",
    "stop being messy and promote people within the company thats been there for years .",
    "-The 25% off staff discount is a credit card. \r\n-The pay... \r\n- As a major fashion retailer staff do not get trained in fashion advice, unless you are a style advisor if you didn't have an interest in fashion it would be very difficult to serve our customers.\r\n-There is far too much tasking involved in a sales assistant role; Customers should be priority but sometimes staff do not have enough time given to just simply serve and be available!! \r\n-You are expected to be involved in night shifts (ex:6pm-3am) on the same pay rate and to sort out your own transport. \r\n-The staff turnaround is very quick, most of my colleagues wish to leave.  \r\n-From senior members of the company we get looked down upon.\r\n-Management under estimate how difficult conflicts with customers can be.",
    "Management can be kind of eh. Does not offer a lot of hours, and inconsistent scheduling.",
    "poor pay and lack of progression",
    "Management and hours vary but it’s retail",
    "One of the worst companies I have ever worked for. Across the nation of the  US there is Very Poor Quality of Management. Half of them don't have a clue as to what they're doing, and half of them have only been hired because they have come from a High end brand background which is a bias move in hiring a manager, as high end Managers don't do nothing all day. If an employee is great at bringing ideas or providing business for the company, management never acknowledge the fact. The managers make poor decisions, and write you up for the most absurd circumstances and expect you to know everything when there has been limited amount of training and the Handbook is very vague. The Managers aren't encouraging at all, and most of them get away with doing nothing all day and also I have seen employees bullied.",
    "One downside to working in retail is that you may feel quite lonely. Also, you come across some customers that can be really arrogant and mean **not a nice feeling when you try to keep a smile and stay happy**"

If you have talent and are willing to progress your career then look else where this is a company that will feed you a lie, and then ruin your talent for its own gain. when it all shuts shop and the directors have their dividend don't say you were not warned."

You can leave. It is a good thing I think to be singed out, cause it's for safety.",

A number of people I know directly have been terminated without reason over whistleblowing concerns or as retaliation for raising legitimate concerns. Additionally, another who have been targeted have been moved to the direct reporting line of a manager they had an active HR complaint against.

If you are an aspiring engineer, this place might not be for you because career growth and development for engineers is not a priority. The rewards and growth promises are reserved for everyone except engineers so many talented engineers leave the company. This makes the product quality poor and below standards.",
    "Old Giant\r\nSlow work\r\nSays its innovative and cutting edge, but not really\r\nFlashy promises and products that lack \r\nManagement lacks vision\r\nOverall, I believe it was my mistake to join the company as a fresh graduate. SAP is the company you join when you want to retire and end your career. You will not find much growth. You will not learn many new things. People stick with the company just to get their benefits, do their 9-5 and go back home to family. If that is what you want, SAP is awesome. If you are a graduate and want to advance your career, STAY AWAY\r\n\r\nMy general feeling about SAP is that the company is afloat because many other enterprises use their products and its expensive to switch.

Some managers expect employees to work for stretched hours to deliver the \"Undeliverable\"\r\n5. Managers take more commitments than their teams can deliver; consequently pressurizing and forcing the team to work for more hours to please the bosses!\r\n6. Undue favour shown to people from specific region/state of the country.\r\n7. Everything happens only by politics / networking / pampering your boss.\r\n8. You will get good annual ratings, only if you can fill your boss ears with bad gossips about others (leg pulling), stay longer in office, no matter you work or not!\r\n9. Management is least bothered about your expertise; interest in any topic; you have to work on whatever technology they say!\r\n\r\nAdvice to any prospective candidate: If the prospective project is in Globalization; and if you are not good at pampering managers, then don't join the team!",

    "As a software engineer, the biggest downside for me working at Thomson Reuters is that it's not a software company; it's an information company. This company doesn't innovate in the technology field. For those who are interested in using the latest technologies that other companies offer but aren't interested in innovating in the field of technology yourself, this might be a good fit for you.",

    "- TR's culture is rich and lazy.  The company makes too much money too easily for people to remain hungry and competitive.\r\n- TR is so big and slow to change, it misses the market opportunities by 2 to 5 years.  After a small, hungry competitor has proved a market, TR goes into it and struggles for 3 to 5 years to catch up.\r\n- So many processes internally are mismanaged that you have to be ready for disfunctional relationships, \"big company craziness\" and people who keep saying, year after year after year, that \"things are going to get better\" and they never do...\r\n- Products are often behind the market in capability and innovation.\r\n- Industry leading products are always on the drawing board, but are literally YEARS late in being delivered by product management.\r\n- The culture is VERY hierarchical. People \"wear their stripes on their sleeves\" and believe that \"having the title\" is as important as \"being right\", when it's not.  WRONG is WRONG, no matter what your title.",

    "Job can be monotonous, you're calling CPAs all day everyday trying to open their eyes to software. If you don't like calling and making new connections, you won't like this job. Very quota driven.",
    "low pay - not a ton of growth available",
    "Compensation is mid-range, could be more.",
    "In terms of editorial roles, you may want to keep your time limited to one and a half to a  maximum of two years.\r\nLearning curve gets completed quickly, task tend to get repetitive and creative freedom is highly lacking.\r\nMuch of the work requires less thinking and more on following a set format.\r\nNight shifts tend to get taxing but differs it can from person to person.",
    "over competitive atmosphere \r\nnot much balance",
    "salary increment is very low as compare to other companies",
    "Even though this is a global company local leadership manage the company as if this were a small grosery. Leaders are friends or family of upper management. there is no room for innovation or talent.",
    "There is so much focus on the \"next\" product that the current ones are suffering through constant layoffs, lack of focus, and lethargic management. The strategic product get tons of resources while the legacy products are being left to die. Client’s complaints are falling on deaf ears as teams point the finger at each other while nothing gets solved. These firms will probably be former clients once the strategic product is ready.",
    "Improve coordination and integration between core product segments within the organization - accelerate sharing of core infrastructure and product 'backbones.'  Need to accelerate joint product initiatives across product segments.",

    "Sometimes too bureaucratic which slowed things down",
    "Lots of pressure, bad food, no entertainment",
    "Economic woes have led to more cuts of staff and reduction in spending for basics (no extra coffee cups or drinking cups for guests).  As you move up in the ranks, opportunities for growth are limited as they are way too top heavy.  Senior management swings from excellent in some divisions to very weak in others.  Politics in the financial side of the business is driving down morale and employee satisfaction.",
    "The senior management team doesn't seem to have any clear vision and strategy for the company.",
    "Management has no clue who have the expertise to get things done effectively and with best result for their customers.  Based on my experience, the collaboration between product managers and software developers is not good -- they don't want input from each other.  If you are a competent software engineer good at what you do, look elsewhere first.",

    "Company is too big for its own good.",
    "few team members putting nose into other people business just for showoff",
    "People who worked on the Thomson Financial side are just waiting for the Reuters people to get shot of them. I understand the place has become massively more bureacratic since the merger. Rumours that Reuters regards itself as a branch of the British civil service appear to be true.",

    "High expectations, demanding schedule, little job security",
    "Very less promotion opportunities, sometimes have to work for long hours",

  "pros": [
    "Great team and support. No one day is the same. You get to travel and to shop at leisure when it's less busy.",
    "The perception of people looking from outside the company is that it’s a well run and organised operation. The reality is far from it.",
    "I was happy I could start my life in England in Grosvenor. Really friendly staff and managers who helped me improve my English."
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Can't think of some, I liked work there",
    "There is corporate and then there is Rank. The company uniform requires you to wear belt and braces at all times.  There’s a real lack of vision and ambition across Grosvenor Casinos. The group is at best 3rd in class in terms of competition. Very tired, lacklustre estate with disengaged and demotivated teams running them.",
    "Poor work/life balance, shift work basis and most work at night so you spend most days in bed. Very little to no social life."

    "University of Warwick provides jobs for undergraduate or postgraduate students through an agency called Unitemps. The idea is great because the university can provide, IT, marketing, finance and many other work experience for students. I consider it a safe working environment that helps students prepare and launch themselves on the job market. \r\nI worked for the Scarman House and I have only good things to say about them. The management was very understandable, supportive and nice. The pay is slightly higher because the university knows how much the students pay for going to school so they pay more, even being a barista at  Starbucks.",

Therefore the administrator will be under enormous pressure to complete all the tasks delegated by the managers working above them. This is not made obvious in the interview. It is totally not worth it as it is a Grade 3 job! \r\n- Dirty politics and harassment takes place behind closed doors \r\n-Senior management team have their favourites.

  "cons": [
    "Willis employees lacked basic organizational skills. Projects were started and abandoned at random, meetings were long and meandering, clients were frustrated with unclear communication and constant lateness. Employees who felt underpaid abused expense accounts and the lack of diversity in this all boys club is pretty astounding.",

    "Meeting deadlines due to seasonality of work can be a challenge.\nNeed to document all your work time",

    "but the sups are distant and unwelcoming, they're only nice to their team mates, Once you're in the door, there's continuous testing and certifications that you must complete to be compliant, the point system sucks-12 points/ month.or disciplinary action, ice machine always broken, seasonal",
    "Meeting rooms. Or should I say, lack of meeting rooms. \r\nI think the floors should have better facilities in terms of internal meeting rooms or breakout areas for internal catch ups and specific areas for conference calls.\r\nThis is very frustrating as we're unable to hold client meetings when required. It's embarrassing when you have to adapt to a meeting room schedule to hold a meeting rather than having a room available at the time you require. I've seen this at other firms but never this bad.",
    "Lack of changes if you don't like a stable life",
    "Most top management work from home, how do you manage a team in an  office when you work from home?  Disjointed in that respect.",

    "-  Terrible work/life balance\r\n-  Huge amount of turnover\r\n-  Managers don't seem to have time to actually people manage\r\n-  Only one promotion track.  People who excel at data analysis are promoted to be managers even if they don't have the necessary skills to people manage\r\n-  Leadership is disconnected from the workload of the team\r\n-  Managers are all in a \"clique\" and adopt new employees to groom to become one of their own\r\n-  Especially for an \"HR\" company, the benefits are garbage.",

    "I cannot currently think of any.  I rated 4 stars because there is always room for improvement.",
    "tight /strict deadlines, work life balance can be compromised",
    "As the company continues to win more clients in the Benefits Administration space, the work load has continued to increase more than ever where Business Analysts are not only being overworked from around Septmeber to December, but are also working many hours year-round. The BA might work 50+ hours beginning in July through February of the next year depending on the clients for which they are assigned. The BA can expect to be extremely busy for about 9 months of the year.\r\n\r\nWork/Life/Balance is not entirely present, but the BA has to try to make it work for themselves.",

    "I am an Engineering PhD Researcher at the Railway Research centre of the University of Birmingham. \r\n\r\nBirmingham is the best research centre in the UK for railway research, with the added benefit of it being in Britain's second largest city and in an industrial area. This gives the University a considerable advantage since there are many other Multi-national corporations/Small businesses in the area to work with. \r\n\r\nThe Research centre focuses heavily on industrial innovation and thus gets a lot of funding from the industry apart from the academic research body.\r\n\r\nTraining opportunities in BCRRE are great and there is funding available to do various courses and participate in conferences.\r\n\r\nHas a really good global reputation and excellent infrastructure. Beautiful and smart modern buildings and green spaces are being constructed. There are many groups to get involved in. One of the most modern Health and fitness centres among any university in the UK. \r\n\r\nNew UK Rail Research and Innovation Network building with many new opportunities coming up. \r\n\r\nAcademic teaching/support jobs pay well and add to your salary.",

I was part of this senior management group and was utterly astounded how they would put people out to dry to save their own skins. The company openly talks about moving forward into the digital space, however many of the actions undertaken suggest this is just city talk. They are happy to talk the talk but do not walk the walk.\r\n\r\nThe company is based in Peterborough which is probably one of the key reasons why they continue to plod along year on year. The talent pool is very limited and as a result the output is somewhat limited. In my experience the company employed some really talented people who were not given the time or resource to make any significant changes.",
    "It is a atmosphere of challenging environment if you are working with other teams based not in same location",
    "Winter flights are few and far between. Salary and commission go down.",
    "Company entered liquidation in September",
    "Office was too cold in the winter",
    "None! There are always little niggles with any company but nothing that makes me not love my job or would stop me recommending it to others as a great place to work."

    "High-fives, fist bumps, and general congratulatory atmosphere when colleagues achieve successes. Living core values with pride and genuine excitement across the org when we crush a client deliverable. In its growth phase, awesome opportunity to contribute beyond ones role, paving the way for advancement, and exposure to roles and responsibilities one might not yet be qualified for on paper. Leadership who care about the human behind the work and encourage balance with personal/family life. In-office gym encourages healthy lifestyle & our women's group, HERd hits social and professional needs.",
    "They offer great benefits and perks. They truly care about their employees and make sure to do what they can to take care of them! They give you really in-depth training and hands-on learning which is great! Everybody is very personable and willing to offer any guidance they can in order to help you get up and running on your own. Great place if you come from a sales or recruiting background.",
    "The people are really fun to work with and we get good benefits and there are perks such as lunch on Wednesday and breakfast on Friday. We go out for drinks on the company every first Thursday of a month."

  "cons": [
    "Cross-department collaboration has been a challenge in the past; working through that in earnest with specific, actionable plan and a clear expectation from top leadership that this is important. Resourcing and streamlined processes have been areas of opportunity creating less-optimal balance with work-life; both have been actively addressed. Only real con today is that I travel too much, so have been missing colleagues back home!",
    "None that I can think of.",
    "A little too driven on experience when promoting. For younger people with little to no experience, it feels hard to make solid moves within the organization. Pay is low for the work we are expected to perform. The job can feel like a call center from time to time."

    "Performance Management (Not changed despite claims to the contrary)\r\nSmoke and mirrors with a pretence of a change. Openly told to \"distribute\" your team or be marked down, followed in the next breath by \"there is no forced distribution\".\r\nunregretted leavers replaced by \"healthy churn\" same thing  disguised by including all forms of leavers, but focus on kicking people out and a witch hunt to ensure a certain number of so called \"poor performers\" are exited to meet targets.\r\nPioneers programme is great, but its core principles are not observed from the top, why waste all that money if you have no intention implementing a genuine change from the top? \r\nAnd by the way, meritocracy does not mean spend one hour a week talking about who we can kick out and how the kicking out is progressing.\r\nMakes coming to work depressing,",
    "I think moving forward BT needs to develop more clarity between departments/offices. This will lead to a greater level of Customer service.",
    "We were given 4 weeks of training which was useless, a lot of time was spent learning on how to use the software which was pretty basic rather than actually letting us know what we should expect. The example calls were hand picked which were the most simple ones and it made it look like that life will be great and jobs really easy. Even when we sat next to advisors to listen to calls they were from a different campaign that doesnt deal with usual calls. After training we entered in the \"Grad Bay\" stage where we were spoon fed sales calls and as soon as grad bay stage was over we were in the standard call queue. \r\n\r\nCustomer care was non existent, they selected options to speak to faults, billing etc were passed through to sales which we werent able to deal with. Most managers arent willing to take escalations or answer questions which arent defined in the standard \"toolkit\". A lot of people have been recruited who have no clue about what speed and allowance mean (GB, MB, Mbytes) and they are the \"Experts\" guiding the customers on broadband. You get penalized for helping customers as it takes precious call time where you could be selling. The worst of all everyone in sales get penalized for selling BT sports as a standalone product because customers didnt transfer line and broadband over to BT. HR is always looking for reasons to put people on coaching plans in view of pressurizing people so they leave the job. Marketing team is out of touch with sales, every couple of months flyers are sent out to customers offering deals which sales cant honour. If not the bonus not a single person would willingly want to work on the sales floor. No acknowledgement of hard work. You start the job thinking you will make a difference and you will not treat customers like other people do but eventually you will succumb to the stat driven environment and stop caring if its a not a sales call.",

    "Where do I even start. If you are an ambitious person that wants to learn and achieve a lot then simply stay away from BT. \r\n\r\nTechnology used at BT is extremely outdated. You will be forced to learn stuff that will be irrelevant anywhere else because simply nobody else uses it. So many engineers only use Word, Excel and Visio diagrams for their work not because they want to, but because they have to. \r\n\r\nIf you want to learn something new and interesting you are on your own, because nobody else around you knows any of those things. \r\n\r\nHowever, probably the worst part of BT is the middle management. I've never seen so many clueless people in one place. They have no idea what should be the direction they should take. Also, if you try to speak out you better be careful. They will be out to get you and it won't be pleasant. \r\n\r\nThis is not just my opinion. It's a universal opinion among the grads. Most of the grads leave before or just after the grad scheme, because they are simply disappointed with their experience.",

Focus on in-year cost savings prevents business growth and reduces customer satisfaction through understaffed services. Appalling recent history of forced performance management curves, managed exits and treating people as numbers not assets. Continual internal requests for paid voluntary leavers with no back fill is exposing service inefficiencies to customers.",

    "Not so many opportunities once you achieved a team leader position",
    "On my first day I've been told that I need to be active on myRapport (which is an internal 'business platform' as they call it but very similar to Facebook) otherwise I will not achieve anything within Rapport. “Nobody is forced to post” as they say but forget development opportunities otherwise. Something already seemed wrong. Later on I realised that this statement was in fact true and no actual hard work was recognised. They brainwash people with the Rapport 'values', WOW award nominations and 'awards' where employees strive to be nominated at all costs. I say this because on many occasions the rest of the team had been let down because someone wanted to impress management (not even the client), not caring about the difficulties they put other people in. Managers are underqualified, often with no experience in a Corporate environment and it shows! Never been called ‘staff’ since I worked at a restaurant where you were just a number. Well in Rapport, it happens. These underqualified and rude managers are hiring the wrong people (obviously) who are impossible to work with and your life becomes about correcting your colleagues mistakes. Your feedback is ignored. Simply ignored. Despite the fact that issues with direct line managers have been reported to the Head Office, no actions were taken. You also often hear managers bad mouth other team members. Makes you think, doesn’t it?! Are they badmouthing you too? Most probably! The Recruitment department takes ages to get back to you (in my case, I missed out on 2 interviews as I constantly had to chase the Recruitment Manager). Sometimes people from the Head Office just pop in and we are expected to drop everything and cater their needs even when it’s crazy busy. Let us remember the red carpet next time… I thought you were running a business here… \r\nYou have literally no one to turn to if you have a problem because no one listens to you. Upon reading some of their responses to the reviews on Glassdoor, I know it’s all nonsense so please don’t even bother to reply to mine. All talk, no action.\r\nPlease avoid this company at all costs. I’ve been treated better in Pizza Hut.",

A boys club with old rich men at the top who have no qualms in shouting at you during meetings or making sexist comments or jokes that shouldn't be told in the workplace. My particular department head was a snobbish bully who favours those who carry a Chanel bag and wear the right designer clothes. Honestly, if you have any morals and value your self worth don't work here. It's all about money and there's more to life than that.

It is very important to the leadership that every team member enjoys being part of the team: In fact all team members assess the case they are working on every week and \"we are having fun working together as a team\" is one of the criteria! \r\n2. People are extremely accomplished but still down-to-earth: this is engrained in the culture of the company, valued and constantly reinforced by the leadership.\r\n3. the saying \"one bainie never lets another bainie fail\" sounds extremely cheesy but it is very, very true. There is no elbow-culture and you can count on the strong support of your colleagues any time in any situation",

It allows for lucrative exit opportunities in the corporate world, great b-school opportunities, and facilitates an easy transition to private equity.\r\n\r\nWorking with smart, motivated, and talented people who truly want to make a difference. I love that everyone is competent and delivers what they promise. There are very few people I don't get along with, and no one whose abilities I do not respect. The people get along really well, and it's a fun crowd to hang out with after work.\r\n\r\nCommunication is pithy and direct within the firm, and people are very goal-oriented. I believe my communication is much more lucid, and my thinking process much more logical than when I entered the firm.",

Some of the best tools available that enable employees to do their job in the most efficient way.  An unmatched culture that is focused on having fun, delivering client results, and investing in employee development.  A flexible working environment that is not about face time.",
    "It was amazing. Learnt so much!",
    "The company truly values its employees; trying to develop and to care in many many ways.",
    "- Top tier: you get to consult industry-leaders, listed companies and hidden champions from all over the globe\r\n- Private Equity Group: the chance to do only PE topics for at least six months. Bain with #1 position in market for PE consulting and therefore many \"hot topics\" for leading PE funds\r\n- People: the people make the biggest difference. Despite all the hard work there is always a great team spirit and there were lots of occasions already where we as a firm/ project team ended up partying together\r\n- No one here likes weekend work\r\n- International staffing",

  "cons": [
    "Sometimes lifestyle can be unsustainable",
    "long hours, regardless of what partners tell you, it is hard to maintain work life balance",
    "lifestyle sucks (a lot of work to do in very limited time), meritocracy is kinda relative",
    "Tough work life balance\r\nCan't guarantee you'll be staffed to something you're interested in",
    "Working hours and sustainability, sometimes short visibility",
    "Need to invest on upgrading internal systems/technologies. Really outdated and slow internal systems which is not acceptable for this day and age.",
    "Work life balance can be off",
    "Hours are long and role requires travel, but not as bad as other consulting firms",
    "I've had colleagues who have been on clients for longer than they would have liked.",
    "tough work/life balance, but better travel model than other big 3 (1-2 nights/week)",
    "Work life balance can be an issue.  Hard to know how tough a given week will be in advance so making social plan can be challenging.",
    "This company is full of people who work very hard so you often end up working long hours and sometimes on weekends as well.",
    "- Can be slow to change\r\n- Challenging to find work/life balance",
    "While Bain has made efforts to moderate the downsides of consulting as an industry, they're still there. Like in any client service industry, there can be last-minute requests, difficult client relationships and crush periods, as well as the usual travel lifestyle. I do feel like Bain does a good job of managing these to the highest extent possible, but they're still a fact of life.",
    "Working hour can be long at times",
    "Crazy working hours\r\nSad Work quality compared to other roles",
    "- It is top tier management consulting - working hours can become demanding sometimes despite everyone trying to avoid it...",
    "Although the firm has been emphasizing work-life balance a lot, you simply cannot expect to learn and deliver the same in a 9 to 5 day. Unlike in a bank, there's no 'facetime' culture, but 60 hour weeks are common.",
    "1. Work is back-end; boring and repetitive\r\n2. Long work hours",
    "Not many cons.  Sometimes it feels like the consulting staff is treated preferentially to other employees which can effect morale with the support staff at times.",
    "Work life balance is okay, but not could be improved",
    "No chance for fulltime offer.\r\nUnable to know the whole picture of the project you engaged in (depends on your supervisor)",
    "Hard to grow within company",
    "Be prepared to deal with unpredictable schedules!",
    "- Unpredictable working hours\r\n- Sometimes tedious (unavoidable) tasks",
    "You don't always get the cases you want when you want them, but that is an inherent quirk of the job.",
    "Work hours are too long",
    "Unlike finance jobs in HK, Bain does not pay a housing allowance.\r\n\r\nThe corporate culture in the Greater China offices means that work-life balance is not respected at all. The US offices would have a 7 or 8pm end on a typical work day, whereas midnight is very very common in the China offices.\r\n\r\nLastly, because of how many people apply and the vast turnover, Bain Greater China simply doesn't appear to value its people as much as the other offices. Within that is the terrible ACN (Associate Consultant - New) position that doesn't exist anywhere else, which is essentially a probationary period for new hires in the Shanghai and Beijing offices before they make the entry level Associate Consultant position.",
    "long working hours. But if you enjoy your work and like your team, this might not be as bad as you think :)",
    "Like every other management consulting firm: lots of travel, not a lot of ownership as you change project every couple months.",
    "Hard job with high work load",
    "Working hours can be long",
    "No cons, just normal stuff of the industry of consulting",
    "In a professional services firm lifestyle is not always predictable but management does the best they can to plan ahead to reduce issues",
    "If you will be working many years in Bain, you will take it granted to have such a great environment to work... and will notice only when you leave Bain!!",
    "Can have a very high volume",
    "Cases vary and can sometimes be very demanding with long hours",
    "As with any client services firm, lifestyle can be vary depending on case and client demands, but the best managers focus the team's time on the highest priority demands.",
    "Due to the plethora of \"extras\" at work, I don't think that Bain pays their support staff at a comparable rate. There is such a fantastic work culture here, that they can get away with a slightly lower salary. Mostly, employees overlook this because of the other benefits the company provides.",
    "Long hours, unpredictable  project staffing",
    "Long hours.  It's fairly high-paced.",
    "Hours are too long, no work life balance at all",
    "The tradeoff between rapid learning and growth is typically long hours, so it's important for individuals to set personal boundaries to achieve work life balance.",
    "The job is unpredictable. You may not know whether you'll be traveling, home, or working late until a day or a week in advance. If you can accept this lack of predictability, you will find there are few cons to working here!",
    "Very busy at times, can be a lot",
    "no  comments. I am very satisfied but the salary seems to be little as we are in Moscow. The salaries could be a bit higher.",
    "It is not easy to develop real-world solutions to complex problems.  As a result, the work can be demanding.  The Bain culture is flexible and supportive - making the long-hours manageable and rewarding.",
    "Overall meritocratic but occasionally inflexible on promotion policy",
    "Consulting is just a hard job - hours, travel and pressure of being in front of a client remain the big challenges in this job. That's not going to be firm dependent, but is the reality of the industry.",
    "The business is built around insecure overachievers.  There's a constant fear of not doing well enough, which is necessary to wring the maximum output for clients but can lead to burnout.",
    "Work is busy and sometimes there is not enough time to complete projects",
    "Many Bainies work around the clock, creating poor work/life balance habits and expectations",
    "Experience is very dependent on your specific case assignment (including client, supervisor, team, etc.), although internship managers do screen the cases very carefully",
    "We work hard and we must remain very flexible to serve the needs of our clients.",
    "Poor work life balance, micromanagement culture is prevalent",
    "None immediately come to mind.",
    "Longer hours for some cases - but management is aware and will usually try and adapt approach to improve sustainability. Generalist model isn't for everyone.",
    "Hard Work Required, Client-Facing Work can mean inflexible deadlines or commitments, Some Travel Required generally",
    "Consulting industry means a lot of travel.  Generally low comp relative to some other options.  I think the lifestyle can also get tough at times, so be prepared for some long hours occasionally.  At those times, the job doesn't seem worth it, but if you look over a 3-6 month period, I always felt very happy to be where I was.",
    "The consulting lifestyle is demanding; if you aren't down with frequen travel, find another career",
    "Very very hierarchical especially in certain locations, not very innovative in IP, culture can be too dogmatic, top down, cult-like",
    "Hours can be tough and unpredictable",
    "Basically, do not expect to have any work-life balance. You will be expected to work most if not all the time, sometimes on weekends or holidays too.",
    "The hours can be very long, doing very stupid stuff on the request of clients\r\nI didn't feel there was as much of a mentorship culture as they sell in recruiting, I felt that I was hung out to dry when the going got tough\r\nType of work almost feels deceitful in that it is often quite simple, but charged out at phenomenal rates and packaged nicely",
    "Long hours, need to improve work-life balance",
    "Almost always in a highly stressfull environment",
    "It can be a tough job, but can't cite any specific cons about Bain - amazing firm and grateful for the career I've started there",
    "I have no complaints about NY office",
    "The support staff is very 'lean' so work load can sometimes be a bit overwhelming",
    "Sometimes a high degree of flexibility is required, but generally compensated",
    "The work at bain is intense and you will likely never feel like you've mastered your job.  You mentally take your work home with you because the problems are both challenging and engaging and there is always more you could do.  The job is a good fit for people who are comfortable, and even energized by, the ambiguity inherent in complex strategy problems.",
    "lifestyle tradeoff against other industries, too much travel",
    "Long hours, significant travel, though this varies depending on project.  Sometimes staffing can be a bit of a black box and as you become more senior, you have more say in what you work on.",
    "can keep you busy - so you need to keep perspective",
    "Not always as sexy as described. There will undoubtedly be plenty of busy work and occasionally long working hours. Lots of travel, dependent on the office.",
    "Work overload time to time",
    "That I couldn't work there any longer!",
    "Working at Bain often requires working very long hours, and can be challenging in that regard.",
    "Limited sustainability as work life balance is strongly tilted towards work, however significant effort to provide options to employees",
    "Of course, there will be moments when it will not be your dream job. For me personally this is when the hours are sometimes long and you feel not a lot of personal progression. But again, this specific situation is when the supportive culture provides you with a network within the organization to fall back on and bounce back stronger."

    "Loved the people, and the snacks! A great company to do an internship with!",
    "good salary and great benefits",
    "*Good Work Balance\r\n*Great atmosphere and respect\r\n*Great professional development",
    "Great compensation, some amazing people. Bloomberg access.",
    "Free food, occasionally interesting work, cosmopolitan employee base",
    "very technical environment, most others in the programming group in London are highly talented. Money is fairly good considering the job is safe and you're not actually in a bank. Some of the work can be interesting though that is very dependent on the group you are working in.",
    "Good people, nice building and amenities.",
    "Bloomberg has a very diverse and inclusive culture. Salary and benefits are good. Many internal communities for connecting with like minded people. The work itself is on the intersection of market data and news in many cases. Software development skills are appreciated in many departments, not just the Engineering departments.",
    "Very agile when projects need to be done, fast recognition (both positive and negative) . Open access to all personnel from the President to the junior most developer. Strong preference to build products than buy",
    "Great training programs, great benefits, great perks, great upward mobility",
    "Salaries are higher than Reuters, etc. Excellent healthcare. Reporters allowed to stay in luxury hotels.",
    "The snacks pantry, the building and other departments.. \r\nNone, because you pay for your benefits. £40 for private doctor.  Lunch: never had the chance to have one, very limited.",
    "great benefits, great culture, free meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner)",
    "Very good food and college.",
    "So many resources are at your fingertips. They already have a lot of the answers to your questions, but, if you need something for your work, they will usually try to get it for you. The company is committed to training. The pay is very good. There is, which has become pretty common knowledge, free food all the time.",
    "Always stretched\r\nLots of opportunity\r\nAsk for more work and ou will get it",
    "Good opportunity and good growth, can learn a lot, always wanted to do this kind of job where it is of my interest.",
    "Very collaborative culture and, generally, everyone is very nice",
    "Great place to work. Great benefits",
    "Great benefits, nice office, opportunities to move around to different departments.",
    "Many employees move around different departments in the company",
    "the snacks are great and abundant",
    "The best reasons to work at Bloomberg are the colleagues. You will work with some of the best and brightest people who truly believe in teamwork."

  "cons": [
    "It seems to me everything is fine.",
    "incompetent middle management\r\nfloundering direction in the data division",
    "Asia management is sloppy. US leadership is very slow on execution, fast in conceptualization, resulting in neglect and an uphill battle over in Asia as they fail slowly.  These factors lead to stymied skills and experience development, Asia management tries but are at the whim and thumb of US counterparts.",
    "I have no cons at this time",
    "Superficial and artificial \"culture\". Independent thinking is not very welcome. BBG is only interested in loud yes-men who self-promote, and fake enthusiasm is the norm. Brash, manic and pushy company ethos makes for deep-set insecurities in staff.",
    "salary is OK, a little below market even, expect to have great opportunities to move up the chain (if you work hard and don't mind long hours or constant trips) but don't expect the salary to follow suit...",
    "the hours are too long and it is expected that you 'go the extra mile' often. Holidays are rubbish. Some of the work due to the technologies used can be repetitive, and often you don't have time to do the job properly. Some of the people you have to deal with on the business side are clueless.",
    "Poor pay, not very rewarding.",
    "need to work overtime many a times, also on weekends, and climatical condition is not suitable.",
    "Management changes frequently, large company so employees are viewed as fungible, little opportunity for advancement from current position.",
    "Not much upward mobility due to flat hierarchy",
    "Lack of defined processes - very adhoc management, very opinion centric -specific opinions overrule actual performance metrics. Rather closed to new technologies and approaches.",
    "Long hours\r\nLack of work life balance",
    "Long hours, less pay too much work. \r\nWorked in Global customer Support. Company might be very diverse, however a lot of racism. They neglect you if you're Asian or Muslim (seen it 2 times) . Some people are picky in who they like. My training overall was a nightmare and so depressing that I never wanted to go back to work.  They are also hiring new people, but one mistake they are doing is that professionalism isn't there. \r\nI had bad experience, I was bullied and nothing had been done. Not taken seriously and it seemed like they started disliking me after that. Co-worker who bullied me has become worse, I lock myself in the bathroom and cry. I'm worried to approach anyone, as last time when I had approached someone I had been told to face them and speak directly which I did and felt a little bit better, however I knows it wasn't right and no one took my permission I just had to go and speak and since then it has gone worse.",
    "*Better Bonus system linked to Performance with no Cap\r\n*Less Travelling for pure terminal sales person\r\n*Keep this plan B mentality where all departments have the feeling to be a start up",
    "A lot of technology is in-house, so there is a bit of a learning curve when starting",
    "Management won't discipline abusive team leaders. Still sweeps sexual harassment under the rug. Female employees often pushed out after maternity leave. HR doesn't respect employee confidentiality (passes complaints to team leaders). Winkler-era culture of backstabbing and promoting sociopathic editors remains firmly in place.",
    "Mike himself said \"You are only as good as your last sale.\" If you are a sales person, you can do well there, but any support role has a hard time justifying their expense and that is how management sees them.\r\nAlso management will always go for the cheaper option, even when it isn't as good, so it's a nice place to work for a short period of time, but don't try to make a career there.",
    "Maybe this is the case for all high-caliber jobs, but be prepared to make it your life. The rigidness of the writing code can be very tiresome and boring - you won't necessarily want to share your work with your friends. The number of people that have to check off on your work - and color it with their opinions - is enormous, so be prepared to be frustrated as you await permission to launch. The place, though global, is still very much run by a few people out of one office. They don't tolerate mistakes - you will be tossed out - and they don't really care about your suggestions for improvement.",
    "None I can think of. Pay is fairly good, but maybe not as good as some other companies might provide.",
    "I have None to speak about!",
    "Roles and promotions are sometimes limited by location as the company is very New York centric, and outside of that focusses on London and Hong Kong for some roles.",
    "There are not any cons"

    "Targets are almost impossible to achieve.\r\n\r\nTargeted call time is less than 640 seconds but no lower than 560, leaving just over a minute for error. Call structure is made unnecessarily long and convoluted however you are expected to whizz through calls ticking all the boxes to avoid pressure over stats and low quality scores.\r\n\r\nIn general enquiries, you are for some reason expected to pitch 2-3 product sales on every single call, regardless of what the call is regarding. If a customer calls to raise a complaint, to be transferred to another department or even advise they cannot afford to pay their bills, you must attempt to sell them products or you are pulled up. If you are a compassionate person you will struggle with this job. You are targeted on sales \"leads\". If you get one, you're waiting at the very least 5 minutes to get through to sales for them to put it through for you.\r\n\r\nAnything that will actually save the customer money is made as difficult as possible. Tariff changes in particular seem to be impossible to arrange over the phone. If the customer is unable to change tariff online (so, elderly and otherwise vulnerable customers) the tariff change department will keep you on hold for ages and even then will often refuse to take the call and insist you complete a lengthy form for a call back because they are \" too busy\". You are expected to complete this form, a standard note detailing the tariff the customer wants to go on, take meter readings, calculate an annual forecast and set up a direct debit for them before they will even consider calling the customer back. The callbacks have a backlog of about 3 weeks currently. This understandably creates a lot of customer complaints which the general enquiries agent must take responsibility for.\r\n\r\nSome departments will refuse to deal with customers directly and make you go backwards and forwards with the customer on hold. This is terrible customer service. Other departments will even refuse to deal with you directly, and insist you send them a form requesting their assistance. It will then take them ages to get back to you and they will often reject your request over something petty (for example, I had a request rejected a week after it was submitted because I stated that the customer's meter was \"about 2-3 feet off the ground\" and I was given feedback that I needed to tell them if it was 2 or 3 feet.. Absolutely appalling.)\r\n\r\nThings that common sense tells you is bad customer service are insisted upon. For example, it is for some reason absolutely imperative to ask the customer what their name is before asking how you can help them. I have been pulled up for this. This often winds customers up especially if they have had to wait in a long queue. \r\n\r\nIf a customer mentions the wait time, you absolutely have to open a complaint, advise them that you have opened a complaint and that you will do your best to resolve this complaint before the end of the call. Most customers will then inform you that they are not raising a complaint and you have to explain that this is company policy as they have shown dissatisfaction. This often starts interactions negatively and afects raport on the call. It also eats into your call time and means that the customers already waiting are queuing even longer. An apology should suffice in this instance since almost every customer will mention how busy we are or their hold time.\r\n\r\nBefore you access their account you must inform the customer that you understand their query and that additionally you will \" attempt to save them money elsewhere. \"Attempting to save them money elsewhere\" equates to pitching talk and broadband packages, boiler cover, wiringcover and trying toget permission to send marketing emails etc etc. If you do not offer these products, you get pulled up.\r\n\r\nCustomers randomly get anew automated survey asking about your customer service. There are 5 questions and only one of them asks about the customer service they received from you personally. Even if the customer marks you 9/9 for customer service but they do not rate the company similarly or they would not recommend the company to their friends, you get a bad score for your customer service. \r\n\r\nIf you get stuck on a call past your finishing time you are not paid for the extra time. You are only able to \"bank\" this time if you immediately tell your manager. I rarely do this as it seems petty bringing up 10 or so extra minutes on the phone and my manager goes for an hour long \"manager meeting\" 30 minutes before my shift ends. I'm certain this system is in place because people will feel awkward about mentioning a few late finished here and there. Although SSE don't track you being logged on longer than you should be, they will immediately pick up on lateness. One girl in my training group was publicly pulled up for being 1 minute 20 seconds late. If they can monitor lateness to this extreme, they can certainly monitor time you run over and should be paying you for it.\r\n\r\nIn some departments you are expected to work Saturdays. On Saturdays the canteen is closed which is infuriating as the site isn't close to any food places if you don't drive and the shift is 8am-5pm. They do stock a vending machine with over priced microwavable items for Saturdays, but none of them are vegetarian. When it is open, the canteen is extortionate. A black coffee is  £1.40 which is only 15p cheaper than starbucks and about 15 times lower quality.\r\n\r\nIf you are sick, they expect you to call them every single day even if you have a doctors note stating that you should be off for a certain period of time. If you are off for more than a week they will actually send someone to your home to check on you. Managers are completely unsympathetic. I once had to take my elderly grandmother to the hospital as a matter of emergency and when I called to advise I wouldnt be in I was put through to a manager who asked if there wasn't an \"adult\" who could sit with my grandma so I could come to work. Not only is this appallingly insensitive, but I am 34 and definitely classed as an adult. She obviously assumed I was a teenager because I work part time evenings.",

    "Good hr culture\r\nGood colleagues\r\nGxxxxxx xxxx xxx xxx",
    "Indeed is a fast growing company which treats their workers well. I've been here for a year now, and everyone is very friendly and welcoming.",
    "Company is very solid. Great revenue, runs lean, upper management are genuinely great people. Fun. Their internal social application is really nice for creating a collaborative environment and getting to know people within the company. The ramp up quota is fair.  Compensation is competitive, though not sustainable in how it's implemented. Probably would have stayed longer, but I just had a much better opportunity more inline with my strengths/experience and compensation requirements.",
    "Great pay, they give you autonomy to do the job your way",
    "I like working for a company that's a challenger in the Australian market. Indeed has an abundance of opportunities if you work hard for it. Whether that's in the Sydney office or one of our 60 offices globally. \r\n\r\n1) Unlimited paid holiday is something my friends are certainly very jealous of!\r\n\r\n2) I love my team and it makes a big difference. Everyone's inclusive and works together to support each other. \r\n\r\n3) Free breakfast, a lot of snacks, coffee, catered lunch on a Wednesday and Friday drinks! \r\n\r\n4) Training never stops we have weekly training sessions, external sales kickoffs, and mentoring programmes. \r\n\r\n5) We have multiple programmes that Indeed encourages you to get involved with. Job Squad, Employee Ambassadors programmes, LGBTI , Women at Indeed and many more!",
    "free food supply and snacks, a good starting point",
    "Great management and love working from home",
    "Great place to work. Lots of flexibility",
    "Amazing commission structure. Great work environment",
    "the company nurtures a great culture.",
    "Care about employees welfare and development, great SLT communication and vision, strong strategy for future growth."

  "cons": [
    "happy with everything here at indeed",
    "As a CMA, everyday may seem a bit repetitive, and there isn't much learning after working here for almost a year.",
    "Company is very young, lots of new grads, because of this they have some rules/restrictions that most seasoned professionals will not like/tolerate. Other small things- like sharing hotel rooms, expenses taking up to 8 weeks to be reimbursed, lack of documented policies/procedures - can be frustrating. With the acquisition by Recruit, revenue expectations were very high. In a group of 20, 4 hit quota, then quotas were raised 45% on average. They look for quarter over quarter growth. With seasonality it's just not sustainable and punitive if you sign a customer up for a full year. Also, no mechanisms for negotiating larger/longer deals, same cost to the customer today, tomorrow, signing up for a month, or six months. While they say this is the nature of the auction system, this probably really goes back to having a young salesforce that would abuse those mechanisms. As far career opportunities, in sales your limited, they use the title director for folks who manage small teams. But the company only has two products sold simultaneously, so not many options.",
    "Lack of progression in a career",
    "Hard sales and business\r\nNot super organized",
    "a lot of work, no time for personal development",
    "Salaries could be higher! But the bonuses have healthy accelerators after 100%",
    "Senior leadership bases promotions off of friendship",
    "Nothing comes to mind right now",
    "cannot think of any cons. keep up the good job!",
    "Innovation is a core value of the company but departments are quite silo'ed and it can be difficult to collaborate across different internal stakeholder groups to identify, agree and drive changes to processes."

The key here is delegation, thats why you hire people to manage on your behalf surely?\r\n\r\nThis is by far the worst company/department i've worked for. Although i've heard in areas outside of IT its better. IT people cannot work from home which is the most ridiculous nonsense i've heard in a while.\r\n\r\nOut of date technology, applications, intranet is dire and looks amateur. Communication is non existent, they have no concept of distribution lists, organisationan charts or cross unit information. I work for JLT and feel I know nothing about the company\r\n\r\nHR have no information on payscales, bonuses or payrises readily available anywhere. \r\n\r\nThere is no documentation about any standard procedures in IT such as project management methodology, guides etc. I have no idea how a project gets done in this place and how you would even kick one off.\r\n\r\nNo career development conversations are had and i'm bored to tears\r\n\r\nKitchens are dark and depressing, an entire floor needs to be dedicated to staff with giant windows allowing in natural light along with tv's, book corner, microwaves etc well away from the working desks.\r\n\r\nConsidering they provie benefit packages to companies, what they offer their own staff is rubbish. Pension contribution is too long and no company car, instead is the ridiculously expensive salary sacrifice scheme.",
    "Few growth opportunities.\r\nPromotion process adopted is as per operations model,can't use the same for IT",

    "Prepare for unsociable hours, back to back shifts close-open and at the time extremely tight personnell budgets. The stora manager's role is very much 'hands on'. So, if you believe your education prepared you for shifting stock from several pallets on the daily basis - that's what you get.",
    "no opportunities to change a boring and physically hard job",
    "Long hours without break (the break is unpaid), no water permitted to drink on the shop floor, or check point, you have to leave the queue to go to the  toilet. Generally you have 10, 11 hours night shift and you can finish at 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning. Your rate is £8.25 for Saturdays, Sundays, Bank Holidays, nights. With one word they pay you only this, no more. For contract 30 hours you do usually 40-50 and they don't want to hear you for any adjustments on the rota. You are a slay. At the end of the month you receive around £1000, no more. Even the holidays are when they want, not when you need. The company don't want to waste money for you for training. For two years there I've received only four days introduction training and all this time i'm cleaning the tills or attending the customers. The lack of training and perspective is killing me. I'm now depressive and with no self steem. I'm looking forward to finish the University and try something new. Stay away from this company if you have self respect.",

    "Great pay, great benefits, great atmosphere",
    "great environment to work. You will make friends there!!!\r\nWellington pays reasonably well and they offer good benefits (private health, private dentist).\r\noffices are beautiful and very comfortable.",
    "Privately owned firm which allows them to take a long-term, client-driven focus and not worry too much about meeting quarterly earnings, etc. It is a  collaborative culture; where information sharing and idea generation is welcomed and encouraged. In most cases, it is very much a meritocracy. For the most part, you will find good people employed with a great work atmosphere. The firm offers a generous retirement plan contribution. A good work-life balance is achievable; and with the firm's global focus, there are opportunities to work in and with other regions."
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Wish I had more time to work there",
    "Do not challenge things too much because almost everything should be done in the 'Wellington way'.\r\nThe Company has over 1500 employees but it is run as if iwere a company with 100 employees. Only few people within the organisation can take important decisions.\r\nForget about making serious money, unless you become an Associate Partner or a Partner",
    "They could do better about enabling employees to work from remote locations on a permanent basis. Some may find that it is a difficult place to advance ones career due to relatively flat organization structure and competition from external candidates for open roles."

    "You will get a lot of exposure to different aspects of the real estate business working for a leader in the industry. You will learn your local market well and start to understand how the business works from a broker's perspective. If your ultimate goal is to get into brokerage, you will have a lot of exposure to different teams and will be able to see if one seems like a good fit. If your goal is to stay in research, there are a lot of opportunities within CBRE. Research isn't the sexiest department, but if you work hard and take the role seriously, you will get noticed.",

Most of the learning opportunites are online and they are not supportive all the time in terms of personal growth and sharing of ideas/information. Depending on which service line you are involved with and whose group you fall under there may not be alot of chemistry and cohesiveness. I would not reccomend being middle management, rather upper management or an employee. Also the paperwork is insurmountable. There is literally a form for a form. Not to mention the ever changing procedures as well as guidelines that do not make for a consistently productive environment.",
    "hard to make a living anywhere nowadays at just $12\\ hour.  The expectations far exceed $12\\ hour worth of work.  Pair that with the pressure that we have to deal with, the inability to protect ourselves and the butt kissing to the tenants creates an atmosphere where the security officers aren't taken seriously and no tenant accountability.  However the security officers get held accountable.",

I was very suspicious of what working for GSK would be like, but have been pleasantly surprised in every way. In some ways, it is even more of a positive, nurturing, \"do-gooder\" environment with people even more committed to making the world better than most of the NGOs for which i had previously worked.\r\n\r\nLeadership on site is open and accessible and committed to doing good work in the world and maintaining a really positive work environment.\r\n\r\nthe new R&D center is in an innovative and newly renovated complex in Rockville, and they make open space working an excellent experience from the very top to the very bottom.

    "Having been with a different employer in the same sector for a number of years, I now feel that I am in a position to write an objective review of my time at GSK. As different teams at the same company can have very different dynamics and styles of management, these experiences may or may not be applicable to other teams at GSK - I write only based on my own experiences.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n\r\n1) Logical processes and organisational structures. I disgaree with some of the other reviews that claim that GSK has layers of unnecessary processes. This is a highly regulated industry and robust processes are an absolute (and legal) must. Compared to every other company I have worked for, I found the processes at GSK were highly logical, full of common sense, devoid of unnecessary complexity and only involved the people that actually needed to be involved. I found the organisational structures to be similarly logical and, unlike some other companies, I could easily the purpose of every role.\r\n\r\n2) Innovation and improvement was encouraged. I found my suggestions for improvements were always taken on board and I was encouraged to pursue my ideas. This is in contrast to other major companies I have worked for where a suggestion backed by a careful, logical argument of why it would be beneficial to the business will simply be ignored by management with no rational reason given.\r\n\r\n3) High integrity. Although GSK did suffer some unfortunate incidents, I never found any lack of integrity amongst my colleagues and was certainly never put in a position where I had to compromise my values.\r\n\r\n4) Genuine empowerment. I never experienced any micromanagement and was trusted to take decisions independently.\r\n\r\nOverall, GSK continues to exceed all of the other companies I have worked for in the above areas.",

    "Despite my many positive experiences at GSK, I did decide to leave the company (reluctantly, but I believe it was for the best). This was due to the reasons which I have summarised below:\r\n\r\n1) Very limited opportunities to develop in line with one's own ambitions. In my current company, my manager makes a great deal of effort to give me work which I find interesting and which allows me to develop the skills I need to achieve my career ambitions. At GSK, I felt that I was simply allocated whatever tasks 'needed doing' at the time, with very little thought or concern given to whether it was relevant to my aspirations at the company. I also found that management were very reluctant to let people explore opportunities elsewhere, be it in other teams in the same department or elsewhere in GSK. I found there to be an overriding emphasis on team retention to the point where managers appeared visibly uncomfortable if the subject of pursuing an opportunity in another team was raised. \r\n\r\n2) Some managers were reluctant communicators. Rather than managers taking the time to develop an open, honest and trusting relationship with their team members, I found that they frequently preferred to make assumptions about people and were often very reluctant to discuss changes or issues happening in the department. Decisions might be taken about your development 'in secret' without giving you the opportunity to voice your opinion. This is in contrast to my current manager who I enjoy a very open and trusting relationship with.\r\n\r\n3) Very different expectations of team members. I found that the team relied heavily on a particular subset of individuals to complete the bulk of the work, especially when it came to non-routine and more complex tasks. Management appeared to have very different expectations of different team members, even those at the same grade. Some individuals would be given a limited workload of routine tasks and allowed to work at a slow pace, while others would be given crushing workloads and expected to deliver quickly. It appeared that excuses such as \"I don't have the right skills for this\" would result in the task simply being reallocated to someone else, often a person who already had a high workload. Some individuals expect to be 'spoon fed' everything and do not make the effort to proactively learn new skills.\r\n\r\n4) Office environment and locations. The office I worked in did not feel like those of the prestiguous international company that GSK is. It was very dated with stained carpets, dingy lighting and a generally downbeat atmosphere. Additionally, the Brentford, Weybridge and Uxbridge offices in particular are situated in areas with a very high cost of living and there was not a consistent policy on working from home. This is biased against individuals from a poorer background who cannot afford the affluent lifestyles in these areas which some of the older or more middle-class employees can.",
    "micro management, the ride you until you burn out, then they bring in the crop of people. I think his is why they don't want any one with previous pharma experience.",
    "So many restrictions. No chance for upward mobility if you’re in the field. Maybe after a decade you can move to a senior sales role. Resp products are good, but sales strategy is mudane and old-fashion.",

    "Some of the initiatives were not relevant to certain areas.",
    "Management, constant lay-offs, constant change when not needed.  No longer recognizing top sales performers.",
    "Very political and no integrity in management. At the time a former employee was in a relationship with her manager’s manager and even though it was proven with pictures it was very badly managed. Put under the carpet and no HR involvement. A lot of inequality in promotions where promotions were granted to individuals that are in direct relation with management.",
    "Layoffs, outsourcing, and getting rid of people for as cheaply as possible. Not much company loyalty. Difficult to advance past the old guard, as they are almost always given preference for new roles or advancement.",
    "Career path is not clear enough to encourage you working",
    "Very little consideration towards career progression at GSK post-graduation",
    "Impersonal and huge - you're just a number.",
    "The workload may be too much sometimes, but it is manageable.",
    "Lack of clear mission between divisions competing for airtime with customers.",
    "Top down heirachy, where there is no transparency\r\nToo much work for too little people- people are stressed and overworked and it shows\r\nPeople don't care about the company they work for.\r\nvery Corporate Atmosphere, they don't seem to care about the people in the business.",
    "There is a Biopharm CMC group in US in King of Prussia. That entire group can be laid off without affecting the GSK bottomline. They create unnecessary projects just to keep people busy. Whenever scientists accomplish something, the management portrays it as their own success and get bonuses for themselves while writing bad reviews for scientists. The whole group is full of managers, directors, VPs, project managers with couple of workers. So if you do any work, be prepared to get criticism from multiple managers packaged as \"feedback\". I left that place and I have been happy ever since.",
    "The workload can sometimes be overwhelming",
    "Need to push for salary uplift, as company will look out for the company's interest. There is limited ethnic diversity beyond Director threshold",
    "Unrealistic production and sales model-demotivating and unethical",
    "Alot of office politics and sops\r\nNo flexibility in creative thinking",
    "Hierarchical - long decision making process. Outdated technologies and systems to enable employees to deliver more efficiently.",
    "Too many changes in org structure",
    "Bureaucratic. \r\nGSK takes a now obsolete top down approach to leadership. Field reps are told their opinions matter and plenty of meetings focus on listening to field reps but things do not come to fruition in leadership's actions.\r\nWay too many conference calls and desk work. Because I want to do well in whatever setting I am in, this lead to working evenings/weekends regularly. \r\nPriority after priority... there are too many and they're ever changing. \r\nBonuses are based on quality (subjective) rather than quantity. This can be good if you drink the GSK Kool-aid, but most find it frustrating. \r\nLogging calls is extremely cumbersome because of an outdated system. \r\nGSK has a way of overcomplicating things.",
    "Unfortuntely the increased demand for lower cost health care and the push to use  more and more generics has limted the access to providers that were once open to the latest information.  It is now filtered through various medical formularies that take from the physician the \"art of practicing medicine\".  These are among the greatest minds ever on the earth and they have to limit their gift to fit in an ever shrinking box of managed care rules and regulations.  Society as a whole suffers this great loss!",
    "low income\r\nno hope to progress\r\nWasting time",
    "Bad UK health coverage, they handle redundancies and HR issues terribly",
    "Salaries could be higher but with the new CEO coming in I think some big changes for the better are on the horizon.",
    "training structure was not good.",
    "Slow growth, lack of direction due to complacency",
    "Not easy to voice your opinion as a student intern - excluded from group meetings. No input into research objectives",
    "GSK is a great company overall. However, they seem to go through restructuring every 6 months to 12 months, which creates fear across the company.  The good outweighs the bad - especially for the money and benefits.",
    "- fluid nature of working and lack clarity in process can be an issue for junior level\r\n- not as fast as other fmcg",
    "Wage are low compared to other local companies, somewhat frequent turnover",
    "nothing that i can think of",
    "Stuck to old ways of working\r\nNew ideas take too long to execute and implement, eventually fizzle out",

    "With the continued and expected future layoffs as well as impending changes in upper management, the direction of the company is in doubt.",
    "nothing to complain about, all good",
    "Very far from City."

There have been even suicidal attempts.\r\n\r\nYou work as five but you earn as one.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you have some relatives or friends working as managers in the same store, you will probably have 8 or less ;) hours a day of peaceful work.

    "There are great benefits and flexibility",
    "It such an inclusive community. Everyone is respected and acknowledged for their ideas. There is a large community of international staff and student on the campus",
    "flexible ease adaptable open nice",
    "Good holiday, flexible working options",
    "1. High quality research profile in chemical engineering\r\n2. Diversity of research fields\r\n3. High quality lab equipment\r\n4. Located in a nice city\r\n5. Friendly and helpful people",
    "Friendly atmosphere, great family friendly policies and flexibility, opportunities to progress if you're proactive about them, annual pay increments as per all UK HEIs, decent holidays plus 'university closed days' so no working Christmas or Easter.",
    "Leeds has a great name, in some cases has great resources, and, therefore, its great to have on your CV.",
    "Flexible work hours in a youthful working culture with very long holidays. Exciting cutting edge research institution and a real feeling of doing work of international value",
    "Fantastic people, always there to help, great rate of pay.",
    "Campus, Flexible working, holidays and other benefits.",
    "Good benefits, relaxed atmosphere, professional colleagues",

    "Poor support structures (finance, computing). Support staff are excellent but the structures have not been designed to assist/benefit the staff.\r\nLack of foresight in interdisciplinary activity.",
    "nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing",
    "Always busy, not well paid compared to same job in other sectors",
    "1. Salary is a bit low for high level education degrees compared to industry\r\n2. Currently, chemical engineering building is under refurb hence a lot of distractions\r\n3. recently, the research budgets are decreasing whereas other universities has increased their research budget",
    "I cant think of any.",
    "As is probably the case with any large organisation there is some inconsistency in the way people are treated in different parts of the organisation and some unfairness (probably some perceived and some actual) in terms of how performance is managed, recognised and rewarded.",
    "Management of post-doctoral/early-career researchers at a University level is poor. There is an archaic system for retaining staff on fixed term contracts, for example having to go on to a redeployment register to, in some cases, re-apply for your job. The promotion process is also more hassle than simply joining a different university.",
    "Heavy workload, but despite that the work was very enjoyable.",
    "Learning and Development (or lack of), upstairs/downstairs feel of academics/professional staff.",
    "none i can think of",
    "No drawbacks, nothing is bad.",
    "Not enough feedback on job performance"

There doesn't seem to be a lot of room to advance from a locally owned hotel in to BW International.  It would be nice to know that you could make a career out of the job that you are doing.  Also, there are so many corporate brand standards and guidelines that you must stick to, and not all of these make sense for every property and employee across the country.",
